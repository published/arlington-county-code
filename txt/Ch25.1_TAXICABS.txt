§ 25.1-4.  Determination of Number of Taxicabs; Issuance of Certificates. 
 

A. 

The number of Taxicabs for which Certificates are proposed to be authorized shall be determined 
by the County Manager, on a biennial basis, not later than July 1 of each even-numbered year, or as may be directed 
by the County Board, after considering for the immediately preceding two (2) years: 

the percentage change in residents, Taxicab and paratransit trips, and indicators of business 
activity, tourism, and public transportation use (jointly “Market Change”) within Arlington 
County;  

Taxicab industry and Certificate-holder performance indicators; 

Competition, including consideration of the number of Taxicabs authorized to be operated by any 
Certificate-holder in relation to the total number of Taxicabs authorized to be operated under all 
Certificates, and the goal of preventing any disadvantageous effects on competition, the quality of 
Taxicab service, and the public health, safety, and welfare resulting from a concentration of the 
total authorized Certificates in any one Certificate-holder; and 

Other factors having, in the reasonable opinion of the County Manager, specific relevance to the 
provision of Taxicab Service to the public. 

 

B. 

Upon making such determination, the County Manager shall issue a statement indicating the 

number of additional Taxicabs proposed to be authorized, the rationale for such number, and the general 
methodology expected to be used in arriving at a recommendation which the County Manager may make pursuant to 
subsection D below. 
 

If an Applicant applies for a Certificate, the issuance of which would authorize an increase in the 

C. 

number of Taxicabs for such Applicant or Certificate-holder, and which increase would exceed the number of 
Taxicabs determined by the County Manager pursuant to subsection A above, then the application shall include 
relevant facts indicating the reasons that the Applicant contends that the Market Change, industry performance, 
Certificate-holder performance, competition, and other specified factors are other than those determined by the 
County Manager.

numbered year, the number of additional Taxicabs (to be authorized by Certificates) allocated to each Applicant, 
including the number of Wheelchair-accessible Taxicabs and hybrid or vehicles not primarily powered by gasoline 
or diesel fuel. 
 

In making such recommendation, the County Manager shall consider the following factors, in no

whether the Applicant will offer telephone-reservation and dispatch service; 

how many of the additional Taxicabs will be Wheelchair-accessible vehicles;  

to what extent customers may pay using credit or debit cards; 

fuel efficiency of proposed additional Taxicabs including whether the additional Taxicabs will be 
hybrid or vehicles not primarily powered by gasoline or diesel fuel; 

the Applicant’s recent vehicle productivity, if any, as evidenced by paid Taxicab trips per 
authorized Taxicab per day; 

the Applicant’s recent vehicle efficiency, if any, as evidenced by percent of total miles travelled 
for which Passengers travel; 

the days and hours for which service will be available; 

the Applicant’s recent customer-service record, if any, as evidenced by the scarcity of complaints 
per authorized taxicab; 

the Applicant’s intended fleet sustainability, as evidenced by the current (if any) and proposed 
fleet fuel-efficiency ratings; 

competition within the industry including the number of Taxicabs that the Applicant(s) would be 
authorized, should the number applied for be granted, relative to the total number of Taxicabs 
authorized under all Certificates, and the effect thereof on the public convenience and welfare; and 

proposed innovation to Taxicab service in Arlington County.  

 
The County Manager, or his designee, may transmit to the Applicants and to all Certificate-holders written notice of 
the County Manager’s recommendations. 
 

Decrease in number of Taxicabs authorized under a Certificate:  

At the time the County Manager issues recommendations to the County Board pursuant to 
subsection D above, the County Manager shall indicate  the number of Taxicabs, authorized by a 
Certificate, that were not operated during any of  the immediately preceding one hundred and 
eighty (180) calendar days. Thereafter, the County Manager shall give written notice to the 
Certificate-holder and afford the Certificate-holder an opportunity to be heard by the County 
Manager.  If the County Manager determines that a decrease in the number of Taxicabs authorized 
by Certificates is warranted because Taxicabs were not operated during the above time period, 
then, upon receipt of notice of said determination, the Certificate-holder shall surrender the 
existing Certificate to the County Manager and the County Manager will issue a new Certificate 
authorizing the specified lesser number of Taxicabs to the Certificate-holder.

H. 

After receipt by the Board of recommendations from the County Manager, and not sooner than 

November 15 of each even-numbered year, the Board, after a public hearing, after considering the factors contained 
in subsection E above, and after determining whether the public health, safety and welfare will be protected or 
enhanced, may authorize the County Manager to issue Certificate(s) to any or all of the Applicants as the Board 
deems appropriate, concerning the application(s).  The Board may determine that no Certificate(s) shall be issued, in 
which case all existing Certificate(s) shall remain in effect.

The Certificate-holder has a continuing obligation to file with the County Manager, or his

every other year thereafter, concerning the Certificate-holder’s claims history and claims 
procedures. The report will be ordered and undertaken at the Certificate-holder’s expense.  

If at any time it should appear that the Certificate-holder no longer meets the criteria required for 
approval as a self-insurer as set forth herein or fails to file any required documents, then the 
Certificate-holder will be given written notice identifying the particular criteria or filing default. 
The written notice will stipulate a reasonable date and time by which the Certificate-holder must 
furnish evidence, satisfactory to the County Manager, or his designee, that the approval criteria are 
again met or the default cured. Failure to respond in a timely manner to the notice, failure to meet

Failure to report any accident as required by this chapter,

Failure to submit information or documents required by any provision of this chapter. 

Process and effect.  

After considering the reasons in subsection A above, and related facts and documents, the County 
Manager shall notify the Certificate-holder, by certified mail or hand delivery, that the County 
Manager is considering a suspension or revocation of a Certificate.  The notice shall state the 
reasons for which the County Manager is considering such action.  The Certificate-holder shall 
have fourteen (14) calendar days after receipt of such written notice to remedy all failures and 
violation(s) giving rise to the proposed suspension or revocation. Upon the expiration of such 
fourteen (14) day period, if all such failure(s) and violation(s) are not fully remedied, then the 
County Manager shall notify the Certificate-holder, by certified mail or hand delivery, of the date, 
time and place for a hearing before the County Manager. During such hearing the Certificate-
holder shall be given an opportunity to be heard, including the opportunity to present relevant 
evidence against any suspension or revocation.  If, after the hearing and consideration of the facts, 
the County Manager determines that a suspension or revocation is warranted, then the Certificate-
holder shall be so notified in writing and the Certificate shall be suspended or revoked as provided 
in such notice.  Such action shall be effective upon receipt by the Certificate-holder of such 
written notice, by certified mail or hand delivery.  

Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the contrary, if the County Manager determines 
that the reasons for any proposed or impending suspension or revocation of a Certificate constitute 
an immediate hazard to the public health, safety or welfare, then the County Manager may 
suspend or revoke a Certificate immediately upon delivery of a written notice thereof, by certified 
mail or hand delivery, to the Certificate-holder, without the necessity of the fourteen (14) day 
notice set forth in subsection B.1 above.  Thereafter, the Certificate-holder shall be given notice, 
by certified mail or hand delivery, and an opportunity to be heard by the County Manager.  If, 
after such hearing, the County Manager determines that the certificate should not have been 
immediately suspended or revoked, then the County Manager may either suspend or revoke the 
Certificate in accordance with the procedure specified in subsection B.1 above, or reissue the 
Certificate without the necessity of a reapplication by the Certificate-holder as otherwise required 
under subsection C below. 

 

 

C. 

Application after revocation of Certificate. If the County Manager revokes a Certificate, then the 

prior holder of the revoked certificate shall not engage in the Taxicab Business in Arlington County, unless and until 
the prior Certificate-holder reapplies for a Certificate in accordance with the application process of this chapter and 
is issued a Certificate.  The prior Certificate-holder shall be entitled to reapply for a Certificate only at the times

A Certificate is a privilege that is in the public trust and personal to the Certificate-holder.  A 
Certificate-holder’s obligations under its Certificate involve services, the performance of which 
involves trust and confidence in the Certificate-holder. 

No Transfer (including, but not limited to, transfer as a result of forced or voluntary sale, merger, 
consolidation, receivership, or any other means) shall occur unless prior application is made by the 
Certificate-holder to the County Manager, or his designee, and the Board’s prior written consent is 
obtained, pursuant to this chapter, subject to such terms and conditions as the Board deems 
necessary and proper.  Any Transfer without the Board’s prior consent shall be considered to 
impair the County’s assurance of due performance by the Certificate-holder.  The approval of an 
application for a Transfer shall not render unnecessary approval of any subsequent Transfer. 

Application. 

A Certificate-holder shall promptly notify the County Manager, or his designee, of every proposed 
Transfer.   

At least one hundred and twenty (120) calendar days prior to the proposed effective date of a 
Transfer, the Certificate-holder shall submit to the County Manager or his designee, a request for 
approval of the Transfer.  The request shall provide complete information on the proposed 
transaction, including details on the legal, financial, technical, and other qualifications of the 
proposed transferee, and on the potential impact of the Transfer on Taxicab Service in Arlington 
County, and copies of the following:

All information and documents required by § 25.1-3.B of this chapter, concerning the 
proposed transferee; 

All contracts, transfer agreements, financing documents, or other documents that relate to 
the proposed transaction, and all documents, schedules, exhibits, or the like referred to 
therein; 

Complete financial statements for the proposed transferee for the last three (3) years, 
including balance sheets, income statements, profit and loss statements, and documents 
detailing capital investments and operating costs; 

A detailed description of the sources and amounts of funds to be used in the proposed 
transaction; 

Complete information regarding any potential impact of the Transfer on Taxicab Service 
in Arlington County. 

In addition to providing the information specified above, the Certificate-holder shall, at the request 
of the County Manager, or his designee, furnish all other information necessary to provide a 
complete and accurate understanding of the financial position of the Certificate-holder’s and the 
proposed transferee’s Taxicab Businesses before and after the proposed Transfer. 

For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to a Transfer, the Board, the County 
Manager, the Taxicab Inspector, or their designees, may inquire into all qualifications of the 
proposed transferee and such other matters as the County may deem necessary and relevant to 
determine whether the transfer is in the public interest and should be approved, denied, or 
conditioned.  A Certificate-holder and the proposed transferee shall assist the County in any such 
inquiry.  If the Certificate-holder or transferee fails to do so, the request for a Transfer may be 
denied.

to be heard. In making a determination as to whether to grant, deny, or grant subject to conditions, a request for a 
Transfer, the Board may consider, without limitation: the legal, financial and operational qualifications of the 
proposed transferee to operate a taxicab business and provide taxicab service in Arlington County; any potential 
effects of the transfer on Taxicab Service, whether a Certificate-holder is in compliance with the existing Certificate 
and this chapter and, if not, the proposed transferee’s commitment to cure such noncompliance; whether the 
transferee owns or controls any other Taxicab Business, and whether operation by the transferee or approval of the 
Transfer would adversely affect the provision of Taxicab Service in Arlington County, or the health, safety and 
welfare of the citizens of Arlington County and the public at large. 
 

D. 

Transferee’s agreement.  No request for a Transfer of a Certificate shall be granted unless the 

transferee agrees in writing that it will abide by and accept all terms of this chapter and any conditions placed upon 
the transfer by the Board.  Upon approval of a Transfer, the Certificate-holder shall surrender to the County 
Manager the Certificate and a new Certificate, consistent with the Board approval, shall be issued by the County 
Manager or his designee, to the transferee. 
 

Approval does not constitute waiver.  Approval by the Board of a Transfer does not constitute a 

waiver or release of any of the rights of the County under this chapter, whether arising before or after the date of the 
Transfer. 
 

E. 

As provided in § 25.1-23.A.1, a Certificate is personal to a Certificate-holder.  A Certificate shall 

F. 

not be assigned, leased, or sold.  A Certificate may be Transferred as provided in, and upon compliance with, the 
requirements of this section.  It is not the intention of this subsection to prohibit any lease, contract, or other 
permission between a Certificate-holder and a Driver to operate a Taxicab authorized under a duly issued 
Certificate, or between a Certificate-holder and a Vehicle Owner, provided that such lease, contract, or other 
permission is not otherwise inconsistent with the other provisions of this chapter.

§ 25.1-24. Notification in Taxicabs of Proposed Amendments to this Chapter. 
 

Upon written direction from the County Manager to each Certificate-holder, such Certificate-holder shall 

cause to be conspicuously displayed in each Taxicab a notice indicating the date, purpose and place of a public 
hearing during which amendments to this chapter are scheduled to be considered by the County Board. 
 (Ord. No. 09-16, 6-13-09) 
 
§ 25.1-25. Rules and Regulations.

the Taxicab Business; and, any other matters within the scope of this chapter.
