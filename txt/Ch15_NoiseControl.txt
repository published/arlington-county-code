any built street at its curb or on the edge of the pavement or from any location on the property 
that  receives  the  noise,  unless  the  property  that  receives  the  noise  is  located  in  a  multi-unit

maximum noise set forth in Tables I and II, the 90-dBA limit shall control. Such events and their associated clean-up 
may  not  exceed  the  applicable  noise  set  forth  in  Tables  I  and  II  if  they  extend  later  than  9:00  p.m.  on  Sunday

The potential danger to the community is outweighed by the benefit to the public interest during 
the period of exemption, or 

Compliance  with  the  provisions  of  this  chapter  from  which  exemption  is  sought  would  produce 
serious hardship without equal or greater benefits to the public. 

B.  

 
 
No exemption or partial exemption issued pursuant to this section shall be granted for a period of 
longer than one (1) year; but any such exemption or partial exemption may be renewed for a period of up to one (1) 
additional  year  at  a  time  if,  after  being  duly  considered  at  a  hearing  held  by  the  County  Manager,  the  County 
Manager  finds that renewal is justified  pursuant to the factors set forth in  § 15-12.A. No renewal shall be granted 
except on application therefor. Any such application shall be made at least sixty (60) days prior to the expiration of 
the exemption or partial exemption. Any renewal granted pursuant to this section shall be on the same grounds and 
subject to the same limitations and requirements as provided in § 15-12.A. 
 
 
An exemption, partial exemption or renewal thereof shall not be a right of the applicant or holder 
thereof but shall be at the discretion of the  County  Manager. The recipient of any exemption or partial exemption 
shall post a copy of the exemption or partial exemption at the source of the noise. 
 
 
Nothing in this  section, and no exemption, partial exemption or renewal granted pursuant hereto 
shall be construed to prevent or limit the application of the emergency provision and procedures of § 15-11.A of this 
chapter to any person or his, her or its property.

In  any  case  where  a  provision  of  this  chapter  is  found  to  be  in  conflict  with  any  other  provision  of  the 
Arlington  County  Code  existing  on  the  effective  date  of  this  chapter,  the  provision  which  establishes  the  more 
stringent standard for the promotion and protection of the health and safety of the  public shall prevail. In any case 
where a provision of this chapter is found to be in conflict with any other provision of the Arlington County Code 
existing  on  the  effective  date  of  this  chapter  which  establishes  a  less  stringent  standard  for  the  promotion  and 
protection of the health and safety of the public, the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed to prevail; and such 
other provisions are hereby declared to be repealed to the extent that they may be found in conflict with this chapter.
