prior to his normal, early, ordinary or service-connected disability retirement, a joint life and survivorship pension of 
actuarial  value  equivalent  to  that  of  the  annual  retirement  allowance  to  which  he  would  otherwise  be  entitled  as 
determined  by  the  actuary.  Such  joint  life  and  survivorship  benefit  shall  be  on  the  basis  of  a  lifetime  annual 
retirement allowance to the retired member with either a like amount of pension, two-thirds (2/3) or one-half (1/2) 
thereof being continued to his beneficiary if said beneficiary survives him. The annual retirement allowance payable 
monthly shall be determined on the basis of equivalent actuarial values according to the ages, at the member's actual 
retirement date, of the member and of his beneficiary, and shall be payable as long as either lives. The payment of 
any retirement allowance in an optional form shall be calculated at the member’s actual retirement date using the 
actuarial equivalent of the normal retirement allowance payable under the System using RP-2000 Healthy Annuitant 
With  White  Collar  Adjustment  projected  with  Scale  AA  to  2010  for  mortality  rates  and  7.5%  interest.  The 
Retirement Board shall have the authority to change the mortality rate and/or interest rate and such rates shall be 
published  in  the  System’s  annual  valuation  and  are  incorporated  in  the  Code  by  reference.  If  so  elected,  the 
allowance shall be paid as long as: 

 
A. 

C. 

B. 

  
The retired member lives, with either a like amount of pension, two-thirds (2/3) or one-half (1/2) 
thereof continued for as long as the beneficiary lives after the death of the retired member. The election shall remain 
in effect if the member dies subsequent to his normal retirement date even though prior to this actual retirement date. 
 
  
The beneficiary lives, but upon the death of the beneficiary prior to the death of the member, the 
option  will  be  cancelled  and  the  amount  of  the  unreduced  pension  will  become  payable.  If  the  beneficiary  dies 
before the member has actually retired, the election will be void and the member will be treated as though he has 
made no election. 
 
  
Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, any retired member who elects the joint and 
survivorship pension option may, with the consent of the person nominated to receive the option, cancel such option. 
Such option may also be cancelled pursuant to court order in a case in which the person nominated is a party. In the 
event of either cancellation, the retirement allowance paid to the member in the period after the effective date of the 
cancellation will be the same as if the member had not elected a joint life and survivorship pension option.  
 

The provisions of this chapter are to become effective as of January 1, 1969, and the benefits hereunder to 

begin as of April 1, 1969.

§ 35-42. Vesting on termination of system; Nonreversion of funds.  
 

It  shall  be  impossible  at  any  time  prior  to  satisfaction  of  all  liabilities  with  respect  to  employees  and 
benefits under the Trust for any part of the corpus or income to be used for, or diverted to, purposes other than the 
exclusive  benefit  of  the  employees  and  their  beneficiaries.  Upon  termination  of  the  System  or  upon  complete 
discontinuance  of  contributions  to  the  System,  the  rights  of  all  members  to  benefits  accrued  to  the  date  of  such 
termination or discontinuance, to the extent then funded, are nonforfeitable.

§ 35-44. Effect on Retirement Allowance of Returning to Work. 
 
 
Should  a  beneficiary  of  a  retirement  allowance  return  to  service  as  an  Employee  of  the  School

meanings unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:  
 

Definitions.  The following words and terms, when used in this section, shall have the following 

If the amount of retirement allowances received by him exceeds his accumulated contributions, the 

“Base  salary”  means  an  employee's  base  rate  of  pay  according  to  the  County  Board  adopted  pay  plan, 

A.  

including any market adjustments under the pay plan.  

 
“Beneficiary” means, for purposes of § 35-45, that person or persons designated by the member to receive 

life insurance proceeds from the life insurance policy provided or made available by the employer.  

 
“Direct  and  proximate  result”  means  that  result  which  is  the  natural  and  probable  consequence  of  the 

antecedent events.  

 
“Line of duty”  means on the job in the service of the  member's employers.  Line of duty does not mean 
going to or from work (including between any parking lot or transportation terminal and the employee's work place), 
going to or from meals or breaks, or time spent while "on call" or on stand-by status unless the employee is involved 
in a specific work-related duty during such period.  

 
“Personal injury” means any traumatic injury as well as diseases which are caused by or result from such 
an  injury,  excluding  occupational  diseases  and  diseases  of  ordinary  life.  The  term  personal  injury  excludes  any 
personal injury caused or contributed to by the intentional misconduct or negligence of the member or beneficiary as

well  as  suicide.  The  term  personal  injury  also  excludes  any  injury  caused  or  contributed  to  by  the  member's 
consumption of alcohol or illegal drugs.  

 
“Traumatic  injury”  means  a  wound  or  other  condition  of  the  body  caused  by  external  force,  including 
injuries  inflicted  by  bullets,  explosives,  smoke  inhalation,  sharp  or  blunt  instruments  or  objects,  physical  blows, 
chemicals,  electricity,  climatic  conditions,  infectious  diseases,  radiation,  and  bacteria,  but  excluding  stress  and 
strain.  Death  from  heart  attacks,  strokes  and  similar  diseases  resulting  from  chronic,  congenital  or  progressive 
cardiac and/or pulmonary conditions are not compensable unless a traumatic injury was a substantial factor in the 
death. Heart attacks and stroke shall be presumed to be caused by a traumatic injury where such heart attacks and 
stroke were substantially caused by arduous and strenuous physical work-related activity. 

 
 
B.       The beneficiary of any member who dies in the line of duty shall receive a payment of four (4) 
times  the  member's  base  salary  at  the  time  of  death,  up  to  a  maximum  of  two  hundred  fifty  thousand  dollars 
($250,000.00). Such payment may be received by the beneficiary only after the payment is approved by the County 
Manager as set forth below. Following approval by the County Manager, the beneficiary may elect to receive the 
payment either in one (1) lump sum or in four (4) equal installments; the first installment to be made after approval 
of the application for payment by the County Manager and the remaining three (3) installments annually thereafter. 
In the event that there is more than one (1) beneficiary, no election by beneficiaries is allowed and payment shall be 
of the full payment only, divided between or among the beneficiaries in the same manner which the member has 
designated for the life insurance policy provided by or made available by the employer.  
 

The beneficiary(ies) may apply for payment within one hundred eighty (180) days of the member's death 
by  making  application  to  the  County  Manager.  The  County  Manager  may  adopt  procedures  for  making  and 
evaluating applications for this benefit. The County Manager shall approve payment under this section only after 
finding that the member has died as the direct and proximate result of a personal injury sustained in the line of duty.  
 

Before  approving  any  application,  the  County  Manager  must  receive  a  written  certification  from  the 
medical advisor that the member has died as the direct and proximate result of a personal injury identified by the 
medical advisor and the County’s legal advisor certifies that all the requirements of this section have been met.  
 

The  two  hundred  fifty  thousand  dollar  ($250,000.00)  maximum  established  under  this  section  shall  be 
increased by the same amount as the annual cost of living adjustment made by the Arlington County Board for the 
Arlington County Employees' Pay Plan, beginning with the adjustment made effective July 1, 1991.*  
 

The  benefit  payable  under  this  section  shall  be  reduced  by  any  amount  awarded  for  an  accidental  death 

occurring in the line of duty by the V.R.S., whether by an insurance policy or otherwise.  
 

Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, where the County Manager finds that an employee's death, as the 
direct and proximate result of a personal injury, was intentionally caused by a third party because the third party was 
motivated to cause the employee's death because the employee performed a particular duty within the employee's 
scope of employment, such death shall be considered to have occurred in the line of duty whether or not it occurred 
on the job.  
 
*Effective July 1, 2000, the two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000.00) line of duty benefit increased by the 
annual  cost  of  living  adjustment  equaled  two  hundred  ninety  thousand  three  hundred  sixty-three  dollars 
($290,363.00).

§ 35-46. Maximum Permissible Benefit.  
 

Notwithstanding anything in this chapter to the contrary, the annual benefit otherwise payable at any time 
to  a  member  under  this  chapter  shall  not  exceed  the  maximum  permissible  amount  determined  pursuant  to  the 
provisions  of  Internal  Revenue  Code  §  415  applicable  to  governmental  plans,  as  defined  for  purposes  of  such 
section.  If  the  benefit  the  member  would  otherwise  accrue  in  a  limitation  year  (as  defined  for  purposes  of  such
