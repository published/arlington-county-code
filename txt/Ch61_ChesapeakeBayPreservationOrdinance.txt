§ 61-5. Areas of Applicability 
 
 
Resource protection areas shall consist of sensitive lands adjacent to water bodies with perennial 
flow that have an intrinsic water quality value due to the ecological and biological processes they perform or are 
sensitive  to  impacts  which  may  cause  significant  degradation  to  the  quality  of  State  waters.  In  their  natural 
condition,  these  lands  provide  for  the  removal,  reduction,  or  assimilation  of  sediments,  nutrients,  and  potentially 
harmful or toxic substances in runoff entering the Bay and its tributaries, and minimize the adverse effects of human 
activities on State waters and aquatic resources. 
 
 
The Chesapeake Bay Preservation Area (CBPA) Overlay District shall apply to all lands identified 
as the CBPA by the County Board and as shown on the adopted CBPA map. The adopted CBPA map, together with 
all explanatory matter thereon, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter.

 The adopted CBPA map shows only the general location of the RPA and should be consulted by 
persons contemplating activities within the County prior to engaging in development activities or modifications to 
the RPA. Where RPA boundaries on the adopted CBPA map differ from boundaries as determined from the text of 
this chapter, the text shall govern. The specific location of an RPA on a lot or parcel shall be delineated on each site 
or parcel or subdivision plat as required under § 61-9 of this chapter through the review and approval of the plan of 
development in accordance with § 61-13, or as required under § 61-12, through the review and approval of a water 
quality impact assessment. 
 
 
Portions  of  RPAs  and  RMAs  may  be  designated  by  the  County  Board  as  intensely  developed 
areas. Areas  so designated shall comply  with all erosion and sediment control requirements and the performance 
standards  in  §  61-10  (performance  standards).  Intensely  developed  areas  may  include  those  areas  of  existing 
development where little of the natural environment remains, provided at least one (1) of the following conditions 
existed on May 16, 1992:

A stormwater management facility that collects and treats runoff from an individual lot or some 
portion of an individual lot shall not be located within a Resource Protection Area (RPA), unless 
authorized by the Director. 

B.  

 
 
 Allowable Modifications to RPA Buffers. To minimize the adverse effects of human activities on 
the other components of the RPA, state waters, and aquatic life, a buffer area at least one hundred (100) feet wide of 
vegetation  that  is  effective  in  retarding  runoff,  preventing  erosion,  and  filtering  nonpoint  source  pollution  from 
runoff  shall  be  retained  if  present  and  established  where  it  does  not  exist.  Notwithstanding  permitted  uses, 
encroachments, and vegetation clearing allowed in this chapter, the minimum one hundred (100) foot buffer area is 
not reduced in width.  
 

In order to maintain the functional value of the RPA buffer, existing trees and vegetation may be removed, 
only as permitted by the Director, to provide for reasonable sight lines, access paths, general woodlot management, 
and Best Management Practices including those that prevent upland erosion and concentrated flows of stormwater, 
as follows:

6. 

Trees may be pruned or removed from the RPA buffer as necessary to provide for sight lines and 
vistas, provided that where removed, they shall be replaced with other vegetation that is equally 
effective  in  retarding  runoff,  preventing  erosion,  and  filtering  nonpoint  source  pollution  from 
runoff. 

Trees may be pruned or removed from the RPA buffer in an area no greater than five thousand 
(5,000) square feet or twenty-five percent (25%) of the RPA buffer, whichever is less, for all sight 
lines and vistas combined. The bounds of this area shall be determined in a manner acceptable to 
the Director and are to be based on identified vantage points and the portion of the landscape to be 
viewed. 

Trees may not be removed where reasonable sight lines or vistas can be created by pruning trees 
alone. No more than twenty-five (25%) of the trees six (6) inches or greater in diameter at breast 
height (four and one-half (4.5) feet) may be removed from the areas designated for sight lines and 
vistas. 

A written request for a determination by the Director that the proposed removal of vegetation from 
the RPA buffer is in accordance  with the requirements of this chapter is required. Such request 
shall include a plan showing the following: 

a.

cannot be effectively utilized. 

Allowable Encroachments into RPA Buffer 

When the application of the RPA buffer would result in the loss of a reasonable buildable area on 
a  lot  or  parcel  recorded  prior  to  October  1,  1989,  the  Director  may,  through  an  administrative 
process,  permit  encroachments  into  the  RPA  buffer  in  accordance  with  §  61-13  (plan  of 
development) and the following criteria: 

a. 

b. 

c. 

Encroachments  into  the  RPA  buffer  shall  be  the  minimum  necessary  to  achieve  a 
reasonable buildable area for a principal structure and necessary utilities. For the purpose 
of this section, reasonable buildable area shall mean that area reasonably necessary for a 
principal structure and necessary utilities with compatible bulk and scale to those in the 
surrounding neighborhood or area; 

Where practicable, a vegetated area that will maximize water quality protection, mitigate 
the effects of the RPA buffer encroachment, and is equal to the area of encroachment into 
the RPA buffer shall be established elsewhere on the lot or parcel; and, 

The  encroachment  shall  not  extend  into  the  seaward  fifty  (50)  feet  of  the  RPA  buffer 
unless an exception has been approved as provided in § 61-16. 

2. 

When the application of the RPA buffer would result in the loss of a buildable area on a lot or 
parcel  recorded  between  October  1,  1989  and  March  1,  2002,  the  Director  may  permit 
encroachments  into  the  RPA  buffer  in  accordance  with  §  61-13  (plan  of  development)  and  the 
following criteria: 

a. 

b. 

c. 

The lot or parcel was created as a result of a legal process conducted in conformity with 
the subdivision regulations under Chapter 23 of the Arlington County Code; 

Conditions  or  mitigation  measures  imposed  through  a  previously  approved  exception 
shall be met; 

If the use of a Best Management Practice (BMP) was previously required, the BMP shall

§ 61-12. Water Quality Impact Assessment 
 
 
Applicability.  A  water  quality  impact  assessment  shall  be  required  for  any  proposed  land 
disturbance  or  development  within  an  RPA,  including  development  permitted  under  §  61-7.A  or  categorized  as 
exempt  under  §  61-15.C.  of  this  chapter,  as  well  as  any  RPA  buffer  modification  or  encroachment,  including 
modifications or encroachments permitted under § 61-7.B or C of this chapter. A water quality impact assessment 
shall also be required for any proposed land disturbance or development on contiguous steep slopes greater than or 
equal to fifteen percent (15%) located adjacent to the landward boundary of the RPA buffer. A water quality impact 
assessment  may  also  be  required  for  any  proposed  land  disturbance  or  development  in  an  RMA  as  regarded 
appropriate by the Director due to the presence of wetlands, potential for harmful discharge of contaminants from 
the  property,  or  due  to  the  unique  site  characteristics  or  intensity  of  the  proposed  use  or  development  and  its 
potential impact on water quality.  
 

The water quality impact assessment shall demonstrate that best management practices, including but not 
limited  to  enhanced  RPA  buffer  vegetation  and/or  stormwater  management  facilities  will  retard  runoff,  prevent 
erosion, and result in pollutant reduction. The requirements of Chapter 60 (Stormwater Management Ordinance) of 
the Arlington County Code may not be sufficient to meet the requirements of this Chapter. The water quality impact 
assessment  shall  also  demonstrate  a  net  improvement  in  RPA  buffer  vegetation  and  riparian  habitat.  Actual  site 
requirements will be determined during the review of the water quality impact assessment as well as by any other 
requirements applicable to the site under this chapter.  

 
There  shall  be  two  (2)  levels  of  water  quality  impact  assessments:  a  minor  assessment  and  a  major 

assessment. Information shall be provided using the forms and guidance provided by the Director. 

 
Minor  water  quality  impact  assessment.  A  minor  water  quality  impact  assessment  shall  be 
performed for any land disturbance or development that proposes to disturb up to five thousand (5,000) square feet 
of land in the landward fifty (50) feet of the RPA buffer or proposes to modify or encroach into the landward fifty 
(50) feet of the RPA buffer. A minor water quality impact assessment shall also be required for any proposed land 
disturbance or development that proposes to disturb up to five thousand (5,000) square feet of land on contiguous 
steep slopes greater than or equal to fifteen percent (15%) located adjacent to the landward boundary of the RPA 
buffer.  
 

A minor assessment shall include a site drawing to scale, which shows the following: 
 
1. 

Location  of  the  components  of  the  RPA  as  defined  in  §  61-5.B.1,  including  the  minimum  one 
hundred  (100)  foot  buffer  area  and  adjacent  twenty-five  percent  (25%)  slopes;  the  location  of 
slopes greater than or equal to fifteen percent (15%) located adjacent to the landward boundary of 
the RPA buffer shall also be delineated; 

 
B.  

2. 

Location  and  nature  of  the  proposed  encroachment  into  the  RPA  buffer,  including  the  type  of

vegetation in a manner that provides for pollutant removal, erosion and runoff control. 

C.  

 
Major  water  quality  impact  assessment.  A  major  water  quality  impact  assessment  shall  be 
 
performed for any land disturbance or development that proposes to disturb more than five thousand (5,000) square 
feet of land in the landward fifty (50) feet of the RPA buffer or proposes to disturb, modify, or encroach into any 
portion of the seaward fifty (50) feet of the Resource Protection Area buffer, regardless of the size of the proposed 
disturbance. A major water quality impact assessment shall also be required for any proposed land disturbance or 
development that proposes to disturb more than five thousand (5,000) square feet of land on contiguous steep slopes 
greater than or equal to fifteen percent (15%) located adjacent to the landward boundary of the RPA buffer. The 
information required in this section shall be considered a minimum, unless the Director determines that some of the 
elements are unnecessary due to the scope and nature of the proposed use and development.
