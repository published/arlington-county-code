GENERAL SEWER USE REQUIREMENTS 

 
§ 26-35. Prohibited Discharge Standards.  
 

No user shall contribute or cause to be contributed to the sanitary sewage system, directly or indirectly, any 
pollutant or wastewater which will cause interference or pass-through. These general prohibitions apply to all users 
of the sanitary sewage system whether or not the user is subject to categorical pretreatment standards or any other 
national, state or local pretreatment standards or requirement. No user may contribute the following substances to the 
system: 

 
A. 

  
Any liquids, solids or gases which, by reason of their nature or quantity are, or may be, sufficient, 
either alone or by interaction with other substances, to cause fire or explosion hazard or be injurious in any other way 
to  the  sanitary  sewage  system.  Included  without  limitation  in  this  prohibition  are  wastestreams  with  a  closed  cup 
flashpoint of less than 140°F (60°C) as determined using the test method specified in 40 CFR 261.21. At no time shall 
either of two (2) successive readings on an explosion hazard meter at the point of discharge into the system or at any 
point in the system be more than five percent (5%) nor any single reading over ten percent (10%) of the lower explosive 
limit (LEL) of the meter. 
 
  
in no case solids greater than one-half (1/2) inch (1.27 centimeters) in any dimension. 
 
  
Any  fats  or  greases  including,  but not limited  to,  petroleum  oil, nonbiodegradable  cutting  oil,  or 
products of vegetable, animal or mineral oil origin, in amounts that will cause interference, pass-through or blockage 
of the collection system. 
 
  
Any wastewater having a pH less than five (5.0) or more than twelve and a half (12.5); but in no 
case  having  a  daily  average  of  less  than  six  (6);  and  in  no  case  which  could  otherwise  cause  corrosive  structural 
damage to the system, to County personnel or to equipment.

§ 26-38. Specific Pollutant Limitations.  
 

The WPCB Chief may impose maximum mass or concentration discharge limits, or BMP’s for any pollutant 
to protect the Water Pollution Control Plant from pass-through or interference, or to protect worker health and safety, 
to  protect  against  damage to  the  sanitary  sewer  collection  system,  or to  protect  the  quality  of  the  Water  Pollution 
Control  Plant products  (plant  effluent,  biosolids,  off  gasses,  etc.).  Concentrations  shall  be  determined  at  the  point 
where  the  industrial  waste  is  discharged  to  the  sanitary  sewage  collection  system.  All  concentrations  for  metallic 
substances are for "total" metal. Compliance with all parameters may be determined from a single grab sample. Where 
specific prohibitions or limits on pollutants are developed for the sanitary sewage  collection system in accordance 
with this section, such limits are deemed pretreatment standards.  
(Ord. No. 92-25, 6-16-92; Ord. No. 95-10, 4-29-95; Ord. No. 95-11, 4-29-95; Ord. No. 04-25, 10-2-04; Ord. No. 08-

§ 26-39. Special Agreement.  
 

The  County  reserves  the right  to  enter  into  special agreements  with  users  setting  out  special terms  under 
which the industrial user may discharge to the system. In no case will a special agreement waive compliance with a 
pretreatment standard. However, the industrial  user may request a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard to 
reflect the presence of pollutants in their intake water in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15 or its successor provisions. 
Industrial  users  may  also  request  a  variance  from  the  categorical  pretreatment  standard.  Such  a  request  will  be 
approved only if the user can prove to the satisfaction of the WPCB Chief, that factors relating to its discharge are 
fundamentally different from the factors considered by the U.S. EPA when establishing that pretreatment standard. 
An  industrial  user  requesting  a  fundamentally  different  factor  variance  must  comply  with  the  procedural  and 
substantive provisions of 40 CFR 403.13 or its successor provisions.

No user shall increase the use of water used in any process or operation which is discharged into the sanitary 
sewer or in any way attempt to dilute, a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve 
compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard.

A.  

Industrial users shall provide wastewater treatment as required to comply with this article and shall achieve 
compliance with all categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in Division 2 of this 
article. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the County 
for review, and shall be acceptable to the  County before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and 
operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility for modifying the facility as necessary to 
produce an acceptable discharge to the County under the provisions of this article.  
(Ord. No. 92-25, 6-16-92) 
 
§ 26-46. Additional Pretreatment Measures. 
 
 
Whenever  found necessary  to  protect the  sanitary  sewage  system  and to  determine the industrial 
user's compliance, the WPCB Chief may require industrial users to restrict the industrial user's discharge during peak 
flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate 
points  of  discharge,  separate  domestic  sewage  wastestreams  from  industrial  wastestreams,  and  take  such  other 
measures as may be necessary. 
 
Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the WPCB Chief, they 
 
are necessary for the proper handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease, flammable substances, 
sand, or other harmful substances. Such interceptors shall not be required for domestic users. All interception units 
shall be of a type and capacity approved by the WPCB Chief and shall be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning

Whenever the WPCB Chief finds that any industrial user has violated or is violating this article, a wastewater 
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement the WPCB Chief or his agent may serve upon 
the user a written notice of violation. Within ten (10) days of the receipt of this notice, the user must submit to the 
WPCB Chief an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof to include 
specific required actions. Submission of this plan shall not relieve  the user of liability for any violations occurring 
before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the County to take 
emergency action without first issuing a notice of violation.

§ 26-88. Show Cause Hearing.  
 

The WPCB Chief may order any industrial user which causes or contributes to violation(s) of this  article, 
wastewater permits, or orders issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement to appear before the WPCB 
Chief and show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the industrial 
user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and 
a request that the user show cause why this proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting 
shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten (10) days prior to the 
hearing.  Such  notice  may  be  served  on  any  authorized  representative  of  the  industrial  user.  Whether  or  not  the 
industrial user appears as noticed, immediate enforcement action may be pursued following the hearing date.

continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
 
  
Take such action as might be reasonably necessary and appropriate to address the noncompliance, 
including  additional  self-monitoring,  and  management  practices  designed  to  minimize  the  amount  of  pollutants 
discharged to the sewer. Furthermore, the WPCB Chief may continue to require such additional self-monitoring for 
at least ninety (90) days after consistent compliance has been achieved, after which time the self-monitoring conditions 
in the discharge permit shall control.  
 
 
adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated.

AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS 

DIVISION 9. 

 

 
§ 26-100. Upset.  
 

An  upset  shall  be  an  affirmative  defense  to  an  enforcement  action  brought  against  a  user  for  violating  a 

categorical pretreatment standards if the following conditions are met: 

 
A. 

C. 

B. 

D. 

The user can identify the cause of the upset. 

The facility was operating in a prudent and workmanlike manner at the time of the upset and was in 

  
 
  
compliance with applicable O&M procedures. 
 
  
The user submits within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset a description of the 
discharge and its  causes,  the  period  of noncompliance  (if not  corrected, then  time noncompliance  is  anticipated  to 
end), and the steps being taken to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
 
  
within five (5) days after the oral report. 
 
  
Upset  shall  mean  an  exceptional  incident  in  which  there  is  unintentional  and  temporary 
noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards and requirements because of factors beyond the reasonable 
control of the industrial user. Noncompliance caused by operational error, improperly designed pretreatment facilities, 
inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation does not constitute 
an upset.

In determining what enforcement action will be brought for a violation of any section of this  article except 

§§ 26-35.A and D, the WPCB may, but is not required, to consider: 

Whether  the  user  knew  or  should  have  known  that  its  discharge,  alone  or  in  conjunction  with 

A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit

§ 26-102. Bypass.  
 

The intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of an individual user's treatment facility shall be 
an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against the industrial user if the user can demonstrate to the 
WPCB  Chief's  satisfaction  that  such  a  bypass  was  unavoidable  to  prevent  loss  of  life,  personal  injury,  or  severe 
property damage. In order to be eligible for the affirmative defense, the industrial user must demonstrate that there 
was no feasible alternative to the bypass and submit notice of the bypass as required by 40 CFR 403.17.  

 
Additionally, an industrial user may allow a bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or 
requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operations. This type of 
bypass shall comply with the requirements of 40 CFR 403.17(c)(1).  

 
The County may approve an anticipated bypass if it meets the above criteria. In all other situations, bypass
