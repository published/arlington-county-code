(a) 

An existing commercial, residential or mixed use structure, no less than twenty (20) years of age, 
located  in  the  Nauck  Village  Center  Special  Revitalization  District,  which  structure  has  been  substantially 
rehabilitated or renovated so as to increase the assessed value thereof by not less than twenty percent (20%) of the

of Virginia to permit the County to allow a partial tax exemption for certain substantially rehabilitated, renovated or 
replaced  residential,  commercial  or  mixed  use  structures  within  the  Nauck  Village  Center  Special  Revitalization

deterioration and vacation thereof  which is harmful to the health and welfare of the  County and its residents. This 
article  provides  a  procedure  for  owners  within  the  Nauck  Village  Center  Special  Revitalization  District  to  obtain 
partial  real  estate  tax  exemptions  for  certain  substantially  rehabilitated,  renovated  or  replaced  residential, 
commercial and mixed use structures.

Village Center Special Revitalization District upon which there exists a structure or improvement, or the vestige of a 
former structure or improvement, of no less than twenty (20) years of age, proposed to be substantially rehabilitated, 
renovated  or  replaced  for  residential,  commercial  or  mixed  use  development  shall  be  eligible  to  apply  for  an 
exemption. For the purposes of this section, the term structure or improvement shall be given the broadest possible 
meaning. 

 

B. 

A  property  shall  be  eligible  for  an  exemption  only  if  the  increase  in  the  assessed  value  of  the 
structure from the base value attributable to the rehabilitation, renovation or replacement of the structure is twenty 
percent  (20%)  or  more  of  the  base  value,  and  which  increase  shall  exceed  one  hundred  thousand  dollars 
($100,000.00) as determined by the Director.

where prohibited by applicable law.

consistent  with,  and  in  compliance  with,  all  applicable  laws.  In  the  Nauck  Village  Center  Special  Revitalization 
District,  the  exemption  shall  only  apply  to  properties rehabilitated, renovated  or replaced  via  special  exception  or 
site plan process (not “by-right”).  
(Ord. No. 04-27, 12-11-04, effective 11-16-04) 

 

§ 20-63.  Application Procedure and Processing Fee:

amount, until December 31, 2012.  

 
C.

allocated by the Director to the parcels created by the subdivision or resubdivision.  The  Director shall allocate the 
base value and the exemption based on the ratio of the building areas of the created parcels to the building area of 
the property for which the exemption was granted.
