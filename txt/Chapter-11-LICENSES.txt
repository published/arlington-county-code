“Assessment”  means  a  determination  as  to  the  proper  rate  of  tax,  the  measure  to  which  the  tax  rate  is

shall  include  a  written  assessment  made  pursuant  to  notice  by  the  assessing  official  or  a  self-assessment 
made  by  a  taxpayer  upon  the  filing  of  a  return  or  otherwise  not  pursuant  to  notice.  Assessments  shall  be 
deemed made by an assessing official when a written notice of assessment is delivered to the taxpayer by 
the Commissioner of the  Revenue or an employee of the  Commissioner of the  Revenue, or mailed to the 
taxpayer at his last known address. Self-assessments shall be deemed made when a return is filed. A return 
filed or tax paid before the last day prescribed by this chapter for filing or payment thereof shall be deemed 
to be filed or paid on the last day specified for the filing of a return or the payment of tax, as the case may 
be. 

“Assessor or assessing official” means the Arlington County Commissioner of the Revenue. 

“Base  year”  means  the  calendar  year  preceding  the  license  year,  except  for  contractors  subject  to  the

developers. 

“Business” means a course of dealing which requires the time, attention and labor of the person so engaged 
for  the  purpose  of  earning  a  livelihood  or  profit.  It  implies  a  continuous  and  regular  course  of  dealing, 
rather  than  an  irregular  or  isolated  transaction.  A  person  may  be  engaged  in  more  than  one  (1)  business. 
The following acts create a rebuttable presumption that a person is engaged in a business: (i) advertising or 
otherwise  holding  oneself  out  to  the  public  as  being  engaged  in  a  particular  business;  or  (ii)  filing  tax 
returns, schedules and documents that are required only of persons engaged in a trade or business.

engaged  in  business  may  include  a  location  leased  or  otherwise  obtained  from  another  person  on  a 
temporary  or  seasonal  basis  and  real  property  leased  to  another.  A  residence  shall  be  deemed  a  definite 
place  of  business  if  there  is  no  definite  place  of  business  maintained  elsewhere  and  the  person  is  not 
licensable under this chapter as a peddler, itinerant merchant, or public service corporation. 

“Financial  services”  means  the  buying,  selling,  handling,  managing,  investing,  and  providing  of  advice 
regarding  money,  credit,  securities  or  other  investments  and  includes  businesses  listed  in  §  11-83  of  this 
chapter. 

“Gross receipts” means the whole, entire, total receipts without deduction. 

“Hotels  and  motels”  means  any  building  or  group  of  buildings  containing  guest  rooms  or  dwelling  units 
which are intended, used, or designed to be rented, let, or hired out for compensation to transients, whether 
such compensation  is paid directly or indirectly. This includes  motels,  motor hotels, tourist courts,  motor 
lodges,  bed  and  breakfast  operations,  and  the  like.  Daily  or  weekly  rental  of  units  or  any  sign  on  the

the  amount  is  attributable  to  a  transaction  previously  taxed,  e.g.,  the  factoring  of  accounts 
receivable created by sales which have been included in taxable receipts even though the creation 
of such debt and factoring are a regular part of the taxpayer's business; 

Any amount representing returns and allowances granted by the taxpayer to its customers; 

Receipts which are the proceeds of a loan transaction in which the taxpayer is the obligor; 

Receipts  representing  the  return  of  principal  of  a  loan  transaction  in  which  the  taxpayer  is  the

person other than the offeror, and  which the recipient assigns to the taxpayer in consideration of 
the sale of goods and services shall not be considered a rebate or discount to the taxpayer, but shall

incentive; 

Withdrawals  from  inventory  for  purposes  other  than  sale  or  distribution  and  for  which  no

taxation  of  greater  than  fifteen  dollars  ($15.00),  said  person  shall  file  a  return  even  if  the  gross  receipts  do  not 
exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00).

§ 11-10. License Taxes and Fees for Beginning Businesses. 
 
 
In all cases where a person begins a business upon which a license tax or fee is imposed under the 
provisions of this chapter at any time after January 1 of any year, such license tax and fee are due and payable when 
such person begins business. There is a grace period of seventy-five (75) days from the date of beginning a business 
for payment before a penalty is imposed on any business license tax or fee. 
 
 
Every  person  beginning  a  business  is  subject  to  a  license  tax  or  fee  under  the  provisions  of  this 
chapter, based in whole or in part on gross receipts, shall estimate the amount of the gross receipts he will receive 
between the date of beginning business and the end of the then-current calendar year, and his license tax and fee for 
the then-current year shall be computed on such estimate. 
 
 
Whenever  a  license  tax  or  fee  is  computed  on  estimated  gross  receipts,  any  erroneous  estimates 
will  be  corrected  and  the  Commissioner  of  the  Revenue  will  assess  such  person  any  additional  license  tax  or  fee 
found  to  be  due  after  the  end  of  that  license  year,  and  at  the  same  time  correct  the  estimate  for  the  then-current 
calendar year, until a full year of business is completed. In case of an overestimate, the taxpayer shall be credited the 
excess tax and fee on his license tax and fee due the following year.

§ 11-16. Situs of Gross Receipts; Allocation and Apportionment; Inter-Jurisdictional Agreements. 
 
General rule. Whenever the tax or fee imposed by this chapter is measured by gross receipts, the 
 
gross receipts included in the taxable  measure are only those gross receipts attributed to engaging in business at a 
definite place of business in the  County. In the case of business activities conducted outside of a definite place of 
business  in  the  County,  such  as  during  a  visit  to  a  customer  location,  gross  receipts  from  such  activities  shall  be 
attributed to the definite place of business from which such activities are initiated, directed or controlled. The situs 
of  gross  receipts  for  different  license  tax  classifications  of  business  shall  be  attributed  to  one  (1)  or  more  definite 
places of business or offices as follows: 
 
  

The gross receipts of a contractor shall be attributed to the definite place of business at which the 
contractor  services  are  performed  or,  if  the  contractor  services  are  not  performed  at  any  definite 
place  of  business,  then  the  definite  place  of  business  from  which  the  contractor  services  are 
directed  or  controlled,  unless  the  contractor  is  subject  to  the  provisions  of  §  58.1-3715  of  the

Apportionment.  If  the  taxpayer  has  more  than  one  (1)  definite  place  of  business,  and  it  is 
 
impractical  or  impossible  to  determine  the  definite  place  of  business  to  which  gross  receipts  should  be  attributed 
under  the  general  rule  of  this  section,  the  gross  receipts  of  the  business  shall  be  apportioned  between  the  definite 
places of business on the basis of payroll paid to the taxpayer's employees working at each place of business. Gross 
receipts  shall  not  be  apportioned  to  a  definite  place  of  business  under  the  applicable  general  rule  unless  some 
activities occurred at or were controlled from such definite place of business. Gross receipts attributable to a definite 
place  of  business  in  another  jurisdiction  shall  not  be  attributed  to  the  County  solely  because  the  other  jurisdiction 
does not impose a tax on the gross receipts attributable to the definite place of business in such other jurisdiction. 
 
Interjurisdictional agreements. The Commissioner of the Revenue may enter into agreements with 
 
other political subdivisions of Virginia concerning the manner in which gross receipts shall be apportioned among 
definite places of business for particular businesses. However, the sum of the gross receipts apportioned by any such 
agreement shall not exceed the total gross receipts attributable to all of the definite places of business affected by the 
agreement.  Upon  notification  by  a  taxpayer  that  the  Commissioner's  method  of  attributing  gross  receipts  is 
fundamentally  inconsistent  with  the  method  of  one  (1)  or  more  political  subdivisions  in  which  the  taxpayer  is 
licensed to engage in business and that the difference has resulted, or is likely to result, in taxes on more than one 
hundred percent (100%) of its gross receipts from all locations in the affected jurisdictions, the Commissioner of the 
Revenue  shall  make  a  good  faith  effort  to  reach  an  apportionment  agreement  with  the  other  political  subdivisions 
involved. 
 
Procedure  when  no  agreement.  If  an  agreement  as  provided  in  subsection  C  above  cannot  be 
 
reached,  either  the  Commissioner  of  the  Revenue  or  the  taxpayer  may  seek  an  advisory  opinion  from  the 
Department  of  Taxation  pursuant  to  §  58.1-3701  of  the  Virginia  Code;  notice  of  the  request  shall  be  given  to  the 
other party. 
 
Procedure  to  prevent  double  assessment.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  §  58.1-3993  of  the 
 
Virginia Code, when a taxpayer has demonstrated to a court that two (2) or more political subdivisions of Virginia 
have assessed taxes on gross receipts that may create a double assessment within the meaning of § 58.1-3986 of the 
Virginia Code, the court shall enter such orders pending resolution of the litigation as  may be necessary to ensure 
that the taxpayer is not required to pay multiple assessments even though it is not then known which assessment is 
correct and which erroneous.

§ 11-17. Assessment of Additional or Omitted License Taxes and Fees: Statutes of Limitation for Assessment; 
Extension of Time to Assess. 
 
Assessment of additional tax/fee. If the  Commissioner of the  Revenue ascertains that any person 
 
has not been properly assessed with a license tax or fee due under this chapter for any license year of the three (3) 
preceding license  years or the current license tax  year, the  Commissioner of the  Revenue shall assess such person 
with  the  proper  license  tax  and  fee  for  those  three  (3)  preceding  years  and  the  current  year  except  as  otherwise 
provided in this section. Every assessment pursuant to an audit shall be accompanied by a written statement of the 
taxpayer's right to seek correction and the specific procedure to be followed. 
 
Assessment of omitted tax or fee. If the  Commissioner of the  Revenue ascertains that any person

§ 11-18. Certification of Erroneous Assessments; Refunds. 
 
 
The  Commissioner  of  the  Revenue  shall  certify  to  the  Treasurer  any  erroneous  assessment  of 
business license tax or fee. Upon receipt of such certificate, the Treasurer shall refund the erroneous tax or fee based 
upon the certificate of the Commissioner of the Revenue with interest as provided below. 
 
Interest  on  refunds  of  business  license  tax  assessments.  Except  as  provided  in  §  11-10.D, 
 
whenever  a  business  license  tax  assessment  made  after  January  1,  1997,  by  the  Commissioner  of  the  Revenue  is 
found to be erroneous, all interest and penalty charged and collected on the assessment found to be erroneous shall 
be  refunded  together  with  interest  on  the  refund  from  the  date  of  payment  or  the  due  date,  whichever  is  later, 
whether attributable to an amended return or other reason. Interest on refunds shall be paid as provided below. No 
interest shall be paid on a refund or charged on a late payment, provided the refund or the late payment is made not 
more than thirty (30) days from the date of the payment that created the refund or the due date of the tax, whichever 
is later.

Between  January  1,  1997  and  June  30,  1999,  interest  on  refunds  shall  accrue  at  ten  percent  (10%)  per 
annum. On and after July 1, 1999, interest on any refund of an erroneously assessed license tax shall accrue at the 
rate prescribed in  § 27-3, beginning  from the later of (i) July 1, 1999, (ii) the date on  which the license tax being 
refunded was required to be paid, or (iii) the date on which the license tax being refunded was paid. In the event that 
there is a refund of an erroneously assessed license tax that was paid before July 1, 1999, and a refund is made after 
July  1,  1999,  then  interest  on  the  refund  shall  accrue  at  a  rate  provided  in  §  27-3  after  July  1,  1999,  and  it  shall 
accrue at a rate of ten percent (10%) per annum for the period of January 1, 1997, through June 30, 1999, beginning 
from  the  later  of  the  date  of  payment  or  the  due  date.  Interest  on  the  refund  of  erroneously  assessed  license  taxes 
levied shall not be paid or accrue for a period of time prior to January 1, 1997. 

 
C.  

 
License  taxes  paid  under  the  provisions  of  Article  III  of  this  chapter  measured  by  gross  receipts

Late  penalties  on  omitted  assessments.  A  ten  percent  (10%)  penalty  shall  be  imposed  by  the 

11-17.A of this chapter, if the original tax return was made in good faith and any understatement of tax or fee was 
not  due  to  fraud  or  to  reckless  or  intentional  disregard  of  the  law  by  the  taxpayer,  there  shall  be  no  late  filing  or 
payment penalty assessed with the additional tax or fee except as provided in subsection B below. 
 
Penalty  for  late payment  of  additional assessments.  If  an  assessment  of  additional  license  tax  or 
 
fee is not paid to the County Treasurer within thirty (30) days after written notice to the taxpayer of such additional 
assessment, a penalty of ten percent (10%) of such tax or fee due shall be added to the assessment. 
 
 
Commissioner of the Revenue if the tax payment is late.

from the first day of the month following the month in which payment is due without regard to fault or other reason 
for the late payment of the assessment. 
 
Extension of time for collection of certain assessments. The period for collecting a license tax or 
 
fee shall not expire prior to the period specified in § 58.1-3940 of the Virginia Code, two (2) years after the date of 
assessment if the period for assessment has been extended pursuant to § 11-17.C of this Chapter, two (2) years after 
the  final determination of an  appeal for  which collection has been stayed pursuant  to  § 11-23.2 of this  chapter, or 
two (2) years after the final decision in a court application pursuant to § 58.1-3984 of the Virginia Code or similar 
law for which collection has been stayed, whichever is later. 
 
Collection. The County Treasurer shall collect such penalty and interest in the same manner as the 
 
tax and fee may be collected. Any tax that was assessed and past due prior to July 1, 1999, shall accrue interest until 
paid, as specified below. The interest to be charged on any such delinquent tax payment shall be at the rate specified 
by the Arlington County Code at the time the tax was assessed, and the interest on any such delinquent tax payment 
shall accrue at that specified rate beginning from the date on which the tax was due and extending until the date on 
which the tax was paid or June 30, 1999, whichever is sooner. Interest shall accrue from July 1, 1999, as prescribed 
in § 27-3.

If the failure to file or pay a business license tax or fee was not the fault of the taxpayer, penalties shall not 
be  imposed  or,  if  imposed,  shall  be  abated by  the  tax  official  who  assessed  them.  In  order  to  demonstrate  lack  of 
fault, the taxpayer must show that he acted responsibly and that the failure was due to events beyond his control.

“Acted responsibly” means that: 

The taxpayer exercised the level of reasonable care that a prudent person would exercise under the 
circumstances in determining the filing obligations for the business; and 

The  taxpayer  undertook  significant  steps  to  avoid  or  mitigate  the  failure,  such  as  requesting 
appropriate extensions (where applicable), attempting to prevent a foreseeable impediment, acting 
to remove an impediment once it occurred, and promptly rectifying a failure once the impediment 
was removed or the failure was discovered. 

“Events beyond the taxpayer's control” include, but are not limited to: 

The unavailability of records due to fire or other casualty; 

The  unavoidable  absence  (e.g.,  due  to  death  or  serious  illness)  of  the  person  with  the  sole

In addition to the application to the Commissioner of the Revenue for correction of a tax assessment within

a business license tax assessed as the result of an audit. 

 
A. 

  
Any person assessed with a license tax as a result of an audit may apply within ninety (90) days 
from  the  date  of  such  assessment  to  the  Commissioner  of  the  Revenue  for  a  correction  of  the  assessment.  The 
application  must  be  filed  in  good  faith  and  sufficiently  identify  the  taxpayer,  audit  period,  remedy  sought,  each 
alleged  error  in  the  assessment,  the  grounds  upon  which  the  taxpayer  relies,  and  any  other  facts  relevant  to  the 
taxpayer's contention. The Commissioner of the Revenue may hold a conference with the taxpayer if requested by 
the  taxpayer,  or  require  submission  of  additional  information  and  documents,  a  further  audit,  or  other  evidence 
deemed  necessary  for  a  proper  and  equitable  determination  of  the  application.  The  assessment  shall  be  deemed

prima  facie  correct.  The  Commissioner  of  the  Revenue  shall  undertake  a  full  review  of  the  taxpayer's  claims  and 
issue  a  determination  to  the  taxpayer  setting  forth  the  Commissioner's  position.  Every  assessment  pursuant  to  an 
audit  shall  be  accompanied  by  a  written  statement  of  the  taxpayer's  right  to  seek  correction  and  the  specific 
procedure to be followed. 
 
  
Provided a timely and complete application for correction  is  made  within  ninety (90) days of an 
assessment  resulting  from  an  audit,  collection  activity  shall  be  suspended  until  thirty  (30)  days  after  a  final 
determination is issued by the Commissioner of the Revenue, unless the Commissioner of the Revenue determines 
that  collection  would  be  jeopardized  by  delay  or  that  the  taxpayer  has  not  responded  to  a  request  for  relevant 
information after a reasonable time and the Commissioner so notifies the Treasurer. The term "jeopardized by delay" 
includes a finding that the application is frivolous, or that a  taxpayer desires to (i) depart quickly from the  County, 
(ii) remove  his property  from the  County, (iii) conceal  himself or  his property, or (iv) do any other act tending to 
prejudice, or to render wholly or partially ineffective, proceedings to collect the tax for the period in question. 
 
  
 
  
If application for correction is made to the commissioner of the revenue within thirty (30) days of 
the  assessment  resulting  from  an  audit,  before  the  tax  is  delinquent,  no  penalty  as  provided  in  §  11-19.B  of  this 
chapter shall be imposed on the tax due unless it remains unpaid thirty (30) days after the final determination from 
the Commissioner of the Revenue of the appeal. 
 
  
Any  person  assessed  with  a  license  tax  as  a  result  of  an  audit  may  apply  to  the  Virginia  Tax 
Commissioner  for  a  correction  of  such  assessment  within  ninety  (90)  days  of  the  final  determination  by  the 
Commissioner  of  the  Revenue  on  an  application  for  correction  of  an  assessment  resulting  from  audit  pursuant  to 
subsection A of this section. The Tax Commissioner shall issue a determination to the taxpayer within ninety (90) 
days of receipt of the taxpayer's application, unless the taxpayer and the  Commissioner of the Revenue are notified 
that  a  longer  period  is  required.  The  application  shall  be  treated  as  an  application  pursuant  to  §  58.1-1821  of  the 
Virginia Code, and the Tax Commissioner may issue an order correcting such assessment pursuant to § 58.1-1822 of 
the Virginia Code. Following such an order, either the taxpayer or the  Commissioner of the Revenue may apply to 
the  appropriate  circuit  court  pursuant  to  §  58.1-3984  of  the  Virginia  Code.  However,  the  burden  is  on  the  party 
making  the  application  to  show  that  the  ruling  of  the  Tax  Commissioner  is  erroneous.  Neither  the  Tax 
Commissioner  nor  the  Department  of  Taxation  shall  be  made  a  party  to  an  application  to  correct  an  assessment 
merely because the Tax Commissioner has ruled on it. 
 
  
On receipt of a notice of intent to file an appeal to the Tax Commissioner under  subsection E of 
this section, the Commissioner of the Revenue shall notify the Treasurer to further suspend collection activity until a 
final  determination  is  issued  by  the  Tax  Commissioner,  unless  the  Commissioner  of  the  Revenue  determines  that 
collection  would  be  jeopardized  by  delay  or  the  taxpayer  has  not  responded  to  a  request  for  relevant  information 
after  a  reasonable  time  and  the  Commissioner  of  the  Revenue  so  notifies  the  Treasurer.  Interest  shall  accrue  in 
accordance  with  §  11-19.D  of  this  chapter,  but  no  further  penalty  shall  be  imposed  while  collection  action  is 
suspended. The term "jeopardized by delay" shall have the same meaning as set forth in subsection B above.

§ 11-23.3. Local Tax Opinions.  
 

F. 

Any person may request a written opinion from the Commissioner of the Revenue regarding the application 
of  the  business  license  tax  to  a  specific  situation.  Any  person  requesting  such  an  opinion  must  provide  all  the 
relevant facts for the situation and may present a rationale for the basis of an interpretation of the law most favorable 
to the taxpayer.  

 
Any  misrepresentation  or  change  in  the  applicable  law  or  the  factual  situation  as  presented  in  the  ruling 
request  shall  invalidate  any  such  ruling  issued.  A  written  ruling  may  be  revoked  or  amended  prospectively  if  (i) 
there is a change in the law, a court decision, or the guidelines issued by the Department of Taxation upon which the 
ruling  was  based,  or  (ii)  the  Commissioner  of  the  Revenue  notifies  the  taxpayer  of  a  change  in  the  policy  or 
interpretation  upon  which  the  ruling  was  based.  However,  any  person  who  acts  on  a  written  ruling  which  later 
becomes invalid shall be deemed to have acted in good faith during the period in which such ruling was in effect.

the employing broker. 
 
A  real  estate  broker  is  any  person  not  defined  as  a  salesperson  below  who  for  compensation  or

others. 
 
 
The gross receipts of the broker include all the receipts produced by the broker, his salespersons 
(whether employed or working under the supervision of the broker as independent contractors) and others employed 
by the broker. 
 
A salesperson is any person who, for compensation or valuable consideration, is employed by or

negotiate the purchase, sale or exchange of real estate, lease or offer to lease, or rents or offers to rent any real estate 
or  the  improvements  thereon  to  others.  To  the  extent  a  salesperson  earns  commissions  independent  of  the
