Whenever any motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer is found on the public streets or public grounds unattended 
by  the  owner  or  operator  and  constitutes  a  danger  or  hazard  to  pedestrian  or  motor  vehicle  traffic,  or  parked  in  a

abandoned upon such public property or privately-owned property without the permission of the owner, lessee, or 
occupant  thereof,  or  stalled  or  rendered  immobile  as  a  result  of  adverse  weather  conditions  or  other  emergency 
situations on any public roadway, any such motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer may be removed for safekeeping by 
or under the direction of a police officer or other uniformed employee to a storage garage or area, provided, however, 
that no such vehicle shall be so removed from privately-owned premises without the written request of the owner, 
lessee,  or  occupant  thereof.  Provided,  further,  that  the  person  at  whose  request  such  motor  vehicle,  trailer,  or 
semitrailer is removed from privately-owned property shall indemnify the County against any loss or expense incurred 
by reason of removal, storage, or sale thereof. It shall be presumed that such motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer, or 
part thereof, is abandoned if it lacks either a current license plate or, a current County sticker, or a valid State inspection 
sticker, and it has been in a specific location for four (4) days without being moved. Each removal shall be reported 
immediately to the Chief of Police of the County and notice thereof given to the owner of the motor vehicle, trailer, 
or semitrailer as promptly as possible. The owner of such vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer, before obtaining possession 
thereof, shall pay to the County all reasonable costs incidental to the removal, storage and locating the owner of the 
motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer, or show to the satisfaction of the County Manager or his designee that the removal 
was not authorized or execute an appearance bond in the amount of such charges with good and solvent surety.  

 
Within ten (10) days of paying such charges or posting bond to secure the release of his vehicle, trailer, or 
semitrailer, the owner may request a hearing in writing. Either the County  Manager or his designee shall hear the 
dispute within two (2) weeks of the request, if practicable; otherwise, as soon as practicable after two (2) weeks. If the 
County  Manager  or  his designee  determines  that  the removal  was  not  authorized,  the  owner  shall be  refunded  the 
charges paid to secure the release of his vehicle.  

 
 
Should  such  owner  fail  or  refuse  to  pay  the  cost  or  should  the  identity  or  whereabouts  of  such  owner  be 
unknown and unascertainable after a diligent search has been make, and after notice to him at his last known address 
and the holder of any lien of record in the office of the Department of Motor Vehicles in Virginia against the motor 
vehicle,  trailer,  or  semitrailer,  the  Chief  of  Police  of  the  County  may,  after  holding  the  motor  vehicle,  trailer,  or 
semitrailer thirty (30) days and after due notice of sale dispose of the same at public sale and the proceeds from the 
sale shall be forwarded by the selling officer to the Treasurer of the County, provided that if the value of such motor

Proof of violation; presumption. 

C.  

1. 

Proof of a violation of this section shall be evidenced by information obtained from the System. A 
certificate, sworn to or affirmed by a law enforcement officer employed by the County, or a facsimile 
thereof,  based  upon  inspection  of  photographs,  microphotographs,  videotape  or  other  recorded 
images produced by the System, shall be prima facie evidence of the facts contained therein. Any 
photographs,  microphotographs,  videotape  or  other  recorded  images  evidencing  such  a  violation 
shall  be  available  for  inspection  in  any  proceeding  to  adjudicate  liability  for  a  violation  of  this 
section. 

 
  

2. 

Prima facie evidence that the vehicle described in the summons issued pursuant to subsection E was 
operated in violation of this section, together with proof that the defendant was at the time of such 
violation  the  owner,  lessee  or  renter  of  the  vehicle,  shall  constitute  in  evidence  a  rebuttable 
presumption  that  such  owner,  lessee  or  renter  of  the  vehicle  was  the  person  who  committed  the 
violation. This presumption shall be rebutted if owner, lessee or renter of the vehicle files an affidavit 
by regular mail with the Clerk of the General District Court that he or she was not the operator of 
the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation or testifies in open court under oath that he or she was 
not  the  operator  of  the  vehicle  at  the  time  of  alleged  violation.  Such  presumption  shall  also  be 
rebutted  if  a  certified  copy  of  a  police  report,  showing  that  the  vehicle  had  been  reported  to  the 
police  as  stolen  prior  to  the  time  of  the  alleged  violation,  is  presented,  prior  to  the  return  date 
established on the summons issued pursuant to this  section, to the court adjudicating the alleged 
violation. 

D.  

 
 
The operator of a vehicle shall have violated this section and shall be liable for a monetary penalty 
of up to fifty dollars ($50.00) if the operator is found, as evidenced by information obtained from the System, to have 
failed to comply with a traffic light signal. No monetary penalty imposed under this section shall include court costs. 
Imposition of a penalty under this section shall not be deemed a conviction as an operator, and shall not be made part 
of the operating record of the person upon whom such liability is imposed; nor shall it be used for insurance purposes 
in the provision of motor vehicle insurance coverage. 
 
A summons for a violation of this section may be executed pursuant to § 19.2-76-2 of the Code of 
 
Virginia (1950), as amended. Notwithstanding the provisions of  § 19.2-76 of the Virginia Code, a summons for a 
violation of this section may be executed by mailing by first-class mail a copy of the summons to the address of the 
owner, lessee or renter of the vehicle. In the case of a vehicle owner, the copy shall be mailed to the address contained

Vehicle and Cargo; Charges Additional to Other Liability. 
 
 
Upon conviction of any person for violation of any weight limit as provided in this chapter, the court 
shall assess the owner, operator, or other person causing the operation of such overweight vehicle liquidated damages 
in the amount of two cents ($0.02) per pound for each pound of excess weight over the prescribed limit when the 
excess is five thousand (5,000) pounds or less, and five cents ($0.05) per pound for each pound of excess weight over 
the prescribed limit when such excess is more than five thousand (5,000) pounds. Such assessment shall be entered 
by the court as a judgment for the County, the entry of which shall constitute a lien upon the overweight vehicle. Such 
sums  shall  be  paid  into  court  or  collected  by  the  attorney  for  the  Commonwealth  and  forwarded  to  the  County 
Treasurer and allocated to the fund appropriated for the construction and maintenance of County highways. 
 
 
Any officer authorized to make arrests and weigh vehicles under the provisions of this chapter may, 
for a period of twenty-four (24) hours without a court order and thereafter upon a written order of the court either 
before or after conviction, hold the vehicle involved in the overweight violation, provided the same is not registered 
with the Department of Motor Vehicles, until the amount assessed, if after conviction, or subject to be assessed, if 
before conviction, together with the cost of holding or storing of the vehicle, be paid, or until a bond by or on behalf 
of the offending person is given for payment as the court may direct of the amount assessed or to be assessed with 
surety approved by the court or its clerk. 
 
In the event the amount so assessed be not paid or no bond be given as provided hereinabove, the 
 
vehicle involved in the overweight violation shall be stored in a place of security as may be designated by the owner 
or operator of the vehicle. If no place be designated, the officer making the arrest shall designate the place of storage. 
The owner or operator shall be afforded the right of unloading and removing the cargo from such vehicle. The risk 
and cost of such storage shall be borne by the owner or operator of such vehicle. 
 
 
If within sixty (60) days from the time of the conviction for the overweight violation the offending 
party does not pay the assessment imposed by this section, together with the cost of storing such vehicle and cargo, if 
the cargo is not removed as herein provided, the vehicle and cargo shall be forfeited to the County and sold to satisfy 
the assessment and cost of storage. 
 
 
Upon  notification  of  the  failure  of  such  person  to  pay  the  amount  assessed,  together  with  the 
payment  of  cost  of  holding  such  vehicle  under  this  section,  the  Division  or  the  Department  of  State  Police  may 
thereafter deny the offending person the right to operate a motor vehicle or vehicles upon the highways of this  State 
until such assessment has been paid.

rain, snow or other climatic conditions will seriously damage any of the streets or highways under the jurisdiction of 
the County unless the weight limits provided for in § 14.2-53 of this Code are reduced, the County Manager may, by 
administrative regulation, decrease such weights and load limits for a total period not to exceed ninety (90) days in 
any one (1) calendar year. No such regulation shall be effective, however, until such signs shall be erected at each end 
of the section of the highway affected stating the weights specified in such regulations. 
 
Any person convicted of a violation of any provision of this section shall be punished by a fine of 
 
not less than ten dollars ($10.00) nor more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) or be confined in jail for not less than 
one (1) day nor more than six (6) months, or both, and the vehicle or combination of vehicles involved in such violation 
may be held upon an order of the court until all fines and cost have been satisfied.

§ 14.2-98. Purpose and Intent. 

RESIDENTIAL PERMIT PARKING PROGRAM 

 
 
The creation of residential parking zones is intended to: promote the health, safety and welfare of residents 
of the County by reducing unnecessary personal motor vehicle travel, noise, pollution, litter, crime and other adverse 
environmental impacts; promote improvements in air quality; reduce congestion and/or hazardous traffic conditions 
in the neighborhood; increase the use of public mass transit; protect residents from unreasonable burdens in gaining 
access to their property; preserve neighborhood living within an urban environment; maintain the convenience and 
attractiveness of urban residential living; preserve the residential character of the neighborhood and the property values 
therein; and safeguard the peace and tranquility of the neighborhood. 
(Ord. No. 05-08, 07-09-05; Ord. No. 12-06, 5-19-12) 

 

§ 14.2-99.  
 
 
To those ends, whenever the County Manager or his designee shall determine that the streets of a particular 
district or discrete portion of a district in which residential uses are permitted and commercial and industrial uses are 
not permitted, except transitional uses or by conditional use permit, are being used for parking  by the operators of 
vehicles  while  the  operators  of  those  vehicles  are  using  (1)  districts  in  which  commercial  or  industrial  uses  are 
permitted, or (2) portions of districts in which conditional special uses have been permitted under  § 3, subsections 
A.10.a. through A.10.c., of the Zoning Ordinance, (3) public mass transportation  or (4) other residential districts and 
the average number of vehicles parking in such a manner is in excess of twenty-five percent (25%) of the number of 
parking spaces on such streets and the total number of spaces actually occupied by any vehicles exceeds seventy-five 
percent (75%) of the number of spaces on such streets, as disclosed by an engineering study, the County Manager or 
his designee shall prohibit parking during the hours when such use has been found on those streets of those districts 
or portions of districts found by the survey to have been so affected.  
(Ord. No. 05-08, 07-09-05; Ord. No. 12-06, 5-19-12) 

 

§ 14.2-100.  
 
 
In determining the boundaries of particular zones and portions thereof, the County Manager or his designee 
should  use  the  following  factors:  limiting  size  of  zones  to  avoid  cross  commuting  within  zones;  consideration  of 
zoning  designations  and  land  use  characteristics;  location  of  major  and  minor  arterials,  natural  boundaries,  traffic 
generators,  and  civic  association  boundaries;  consideration  of  driving  patterns  within  a neighborhood,  the parking 
capacity of the street, the existence of driveways and dedicated parking; and other such neighborhood characteristics 
that the County Manager or his designee may determine to be relevant in carrying out the purposes of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 05-08, 07-09-05; Ord. No. 12-06, 5-19-12) 
 
§ 14.2-101.  
 

In such cases the County Manager shall cause appropriate signs giving notice of the prohibition to be posted 
on  those  streets  restricting  all  parking  except  parking  by  the  holders  of  permits  granted  only  under  the  following 
conditions:  

 
A. 

 
To persons who are residents of any particular area in which parking is so restricted, to be limited 
to that particular area in which parking is so restricted for a limited number, determined by the  County Manager or 
his designee, of vehicles owned by those persons and registered in the County.  Each household shall be provided one 
flex pass at no charge, and the County Manager may charge a fee for such additional permits not to exceed twenty 
dollars ($20.00) for the first permit, twenty dollars ($20.00) for the second permit, fifty dollars ($50.00) for the third 
permit, and two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) for each permit thereafter;  

 
B. 

 
To persons who are visitors of or persons who do business with any residents of any particular area 
in which parking is so restricted, to be limited to that particular area in which the visited residence is located where 
parking is so restricted, to be valid for a stated period and the County Manager may charge a fee for any such visitor 
passes created, not to exceed twenty-five cents ($0.25); and

§ 14.2-102.  

 
 
Any such person shall show to the County Manager or his designee satisfactory evidence that he fulfills all 
the conditions for such a permit. Whenever the conditions no longer exist, the person holding such a permit issued 
under § 14.2-101.A or 14.2-101.B shall surrender it to the County Manager or his designee. It shall be unlawful for 
any person to represent that he is entitled to such a permit when he is not so entitled, or to park a vehicle displaying 
such a permit at any time when the holder of such permit is not entitled to hold it. No permit issued hereunder shall 
be valid for more than one (1) year.   (Ord. No. 05-08, 07-09-05; Ord. No. 12-06, 5-19-12)

§ 14.2-104.  
 
 
Wherever metered or other paid parking restrictions are in effect in any portion of a district that becomes 
subject to the restrictions of Article VIII, the parking spaces so restricted may be used by permit holders with properly 
displayed  permits  for  that  zone  and  are  not  required  to  pay  for  that  parking.    However,  vehicles  without  properly 
displayed permits for that zone may park in the restricted spaces and must pay with the exception of vendors authorized 
by  the  free-floating  car-share  program  and  authorized  car-share  vehicles  parked  at  car-share  parking  stations  as 
described in §14.2-109 and §14.2-110, respectively.

§ 14.2-105.  
 
On any block of any street where the conditions of § 14.2-99 above calling for restricted parking exist, the 
 
County Manager may reduce the restriction under the following conditions. If a hardship exists for visitors to park 
because of the unavailability of off-street or other unrestricted parking or other conditions not generally prevailing on 
the  residential  streets  of  the  County,  the  County  Manager  may  conduct  an  engineering  study  to  determine  the 
conditions on the block or blocks in question. If the study shows that less than fifty  percent (50%) of the dwelling 
units  abutting  on  the  street  have  off-street  parking  for  at  least  one  (1)  vehicle  and  there  is  no  other  reasonable 
alternative parking available, the restriction may be reduced to allow parking for no more than two (2) hours with 
permit holders exempted from that restriction.

Mobility Devices in Arlington County, demand for services, support for an open marketplace, and the following 
goals from the Master Transportation Plan (or subsequent goals as the Plan is amended), in no particular order: 

 

1. Quality Transportation Services: How the Micro-Mobility Business provides high‐quality 

transportation services for all users and modes. 

2. Move More People Without More Traffic: How the Micro-Mobility Business provides more travel 

choices and reduce the relative proportion of single occupant‐vehicle (SOV) travel.

approved under the Permit. The Applicant must pay an initial annual operations fee of Eighty Dollars ($80) per each 
approved Micro-Mobility Device for a three-hundred and sixty-five (365) day Permit Term. This fee will be pro-
rated if an application is processed and approved for any Permit Term of less than three-hundred and sixty-five 
(365) days. 

D. With approval by the County Manager or designee, a Permit-holder may include Accessible Micro-
Mobility Devices (e.g. handcycles, tricycles) in its Permit application, and such devices will neither incur a per-
device annual operations fee nor be counted towards the Permitted fleet size or against any applicable Countywide 
cap. If an Applicant proposes a fleet the majority of which is made up of Accessible Micro-Mobility Devices, the 
County Manager or designee may apply established fees and fleet caps as deemed reasonable based on the 
application.

that the Permit-holder has in force at a minimum the coverages below to cover damages for any liability incurred on 
account of any injury to persons or damage to property resulting from the operation of Micro-Mobility Devices, and 
which holds the County harmless for any such claims. The Permit-holder must maintain this coverage until the 
completion of the Permit. All required insurance coverage must be acquired from insurers that are authorized to do

coverages during the term, the Permit-holder must notify the County Manager, or designee, immediately and

obtain an extended reporting endorsement, until the applicable statute of limitations for any claims has expired.

insurance policy is furnished, the minimum amount of coverage will be:

($300,000.00)  

c.  For property damage in any one (1) accident: fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00)

provide the coverage specified above.  

e.  The Permit-holder must disclose to Arlington County the amount of any deductible or self-
insurance component of any of the required policies. With Arlington County’s approval, the Permit-
holder may satisfy its obligations under this section by self-insurance for all or any part of the

do so, the Permit-holder must provide Arlington County with its most recent actuarial report and a 
copy of its self-insurance resolution.  

8. Arlington County may request additional information to determine if the Permit-holder has the 
financial capacity to meet its obligations under a deductible and may require a lower deductible; that funds 
equal to the deductible be placed in escrow; a certificate of self-insurance; collateral; or another mechanism to 
guarantee the amount of the deductible and ensure protection for Arlington County.
