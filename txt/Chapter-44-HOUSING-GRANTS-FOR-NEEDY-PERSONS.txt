§ 44-1. Appropriation of Board of Social Services.  
 

The  County  Board  may,  from  time  to  time,  make  appropriations  to  the  Director  of  the  Department  of 
Human  Services  in  his  capacity  as  the  Board  of  Social  Services,  pursuant  to  §  63.2-314  of  the  Code  of  Virginia 
(1950), as amended, for the purpose of providing funds for housing grants for needy persons.  
(Ord. No. 83-28, 10-15-83; Ord. No. 86-13, § 2, 7-1-86; Ord. No. 92-28, 7-12-92) 
 
§ 44-2. Method of Making Appropriations.  
 

Appropriations shall be made only after the County Board has been advised of the eligibility qualifications 
which  have  been  established  by  the  Director  of  the  Department  of  Human  Services  and  approved  by  the  County 
Manager, and this chapter has been amended by specifically recognizing the income and net worth qualifications for 
each category of recipient and the method for determining the grant to be made to each category.  
(Ord. No. 86-13, § 2, 7-1-86; Ord. No. 92-28, 7-12-92) 
 
§ 44-3. Eligibility Requirements Established by Director of the Department of Human Services and Approved 
by the County Manager.  
 

The  Director  of  the  Department  of  Human  Services,  in  his  capacity  as  the  Board  of  Social  Services,  has 
adopted the following income and net worth criteria for qualification for housing grants and the following method of 
determining  the  amounts  of  the  grants,  to  be  effective  January  1,  2001,  which  have  been  approved  by  the  County 
Manager: 
 
A. 

Maximum incomes. The estimated gross annual income of applicants for one (1) year from the date 
of the first day of their  most  recent earning period shall not exceed eighty-five percent (85%) of 
the HUD Housing Choice Voucher (Section 8) income level, based on fifty percent (50%) of area 
median income, by household size. The income used in determining eligibility shall be that which 
best reflects earnings in the current and subsequent months. 

 
  

 
  
 

B. 

Annual rent. Annual rent shall be used for determining the amount of grant for qualified renters. 
Annual rent will be based upon twelve (12) times the monthly rent as of the date that application is 
made. 

C. 

Determination of grant.   

A  grant  shall  be  the  amount  by  which  a  household's  annual  allowable  rent,  as  set  forth  in 
subsections  1  and  2  of  this  section,  exceeds  forty  percent  (40%)  of  its  net  annual  income. 
Allowable rent shall be determined by using the lesser of a household's actual rent obligation or an 
amount up to one hundred percent (100%) of the HUD Housing Choice Voucher rent maximum as 
used by the Arlington County Section 8 Office, as determined by the County Manager.

Elderly or disabled. In the case of qualifying elderly or disabled persons or families, there 
shall  be  allowed  a  deduction  from  their  household's  annual  income  the  greater  of  (i) 
seven  hundred  fifty  dollars  ($750.00)  for  each  child  or  (ii)  twenty  percent  (20%)  of 
income earned from employment. The amount of the grant shall be computed on the basis 
of the resulting net income figure. The amount of the grant shall be determined by using 
the  lesser  of  the  allowable  rent  based  on  the  HUD  Housing  Choice  Voucher  maximum 
for  a  one  (1)  bedroom  dwelling  unit  or  the  actual  rent  obligation  for  a  single  person  or 
married  couple  or,  the  Housing  Choice  Voucher  maximum  for  a  two  (2)  bedroom 
dwelling  unit  or  actual  rent  obligation  for  related  household  members  who  are  not 
spouses. 

Families with children. In the case of persons with minor children, there shall be allowed 
a  deduction  from  their  household's  annual  income  the  greater  of  (i)  seven  hundred  fifty 
dollars  ($750.00)  for  each  child  or  (ii)  twenty  percent  (20%)  of  income  earned  from 
employment. The amount of the grant shall be computed on the basis of the resulting net 
income  figure.  For  such  persons  with  minor  children,  the  amount  of  the  grant  shall  be 
determined  by  using  the  lesser  of  their  actual  rent  or  the  allowable  rent,  based  on  the 
HUD Housing Choice Voucher maximum, as follows: 

a. 

b. 

For  a  two  (2)  to  four  (4)  person  family  with  minor  children  the  HUD  Housing 
Choice  Voucher  rent  maximum  for  a  two  (2)  bedroom  dwelling  shall  be  used; 
and 

For  a  five  (5)  or  more  person  family  with  minor  children  the  HUD  Housing 
Choice Voucher rent maximum for a three (3) bedroom dwelling shall be used. 

An eligible household's grant shall not exceed seventy-five percent (75%) of the lesser of 
its actual rent expense or the rent maximum. 

The County Manager may adjust the rent maximum when periodic adjustments are made 
to  the  HUD  Housing  Choice  Voucher  rent  maximum,  up  to  an  amount  that  does  not 
exceed that standard.  

Households receiving general relief, temporary assistance to needy families (formerly aid 
to  families  with  dependent  children)  and  all  others  receiving  benefits  under  the  refugee 
resettlement  program  are  excluded  from  eligibility,  except  for  households  which  are 
receiving  temporary  assistance  for  needy  families  in  which  the  head  of  household  is 
either  employed  (working  a  minimum  average  of  sixty  (60)  hours  per  month)  or  is 
enrolled  in  and  scheduled  to  complete  within  four  (4)  months,  a  training  program 
approved  by  the  Department  of  Human  Services  that  has  a  placement  rate  of  at  least 
seventy percent (70%). 

D. 

For  determination  of  grants  for  households  which  are  receiving  a  grant  in  December  2000  and 
which would no longer be eligible based on subsection C of this section, 

1. 

a. 

A  grant  shall  be  determined  by  multiplying  the  amount  by  which  a  household's  annual 
allowable rent, as  set forth in  subsections a and b of this section, exceeds thirty percent 
(30%)  of  its  gross  annual  income  by  a  payment  rate  factor  as  set  forth  in  subsection  2 
below. 

Elderly or disabled. In the case of qualifying elderly or disabled persons or families, the 
amount of the grant shall be determined by multiplying the payment rate by the amount 
determined  by  subtracting  thirty  percent  (30%)  of  the  gross  annual  income  from  the 
amount of annual rent paid or the maximum allowable rent of six thousand eight hundred

eighty-eight dollars ($6,888.00) for single persons or  married  couples or eight thousand 
one hundred twelve dollars ($8,112.00) for related adults who are not spouses, whichever 
is  less.  The  payment  rate  will  be  determined  based  upon  household  income  and  size 
according to the formula set forth in subsection 2 below. 

Families with children. In the case of persons with minor children, a deduction of seven 
hundred  fifty  dollars  ($750.00)  shall  be  allowed  for  each  child,  and  the  amount  of  the 
grant shall be computed on the basis of the resulting net income figure. For such persons 
with  minor  children,  the  amount  of  the  grant  shall  be  determined  by  multiplying  the 
payment  rate  by  the  amount  determined  by  subtracting  thirty  percent  (30%)  of  the  net 
annual  income  from  the  amount  of  annual  rent  paid  or  the  maximum  allowable  rent, 
whichever  is  less.  The  payment  rate  will  be  determined  based  upon  household  income 
and  size  according  to  the  formula  as  set  forth  in  subsection  2  below.  The  maximum 
allowable rent for: 

a. 

b. 

A two (2) to four (4) person family with children is eight thousand one hundred 
twelve dollars ($8,112.00); and  

A  five  (5)  or  more  person  family  with  children  is  ten  thousand  one  hundred 
seventy-six dollars ($10,176.00).  

Households receiving general relief, temporary assistance to needy families (formerly aid 
to  dependent  children)  and  all  others  receiving  benefits  under  the  refugee  resettlement 
program  are  excluded  from  eligibility,  except  for  households  which  are  receiving 
temporary assistance to needy families in which the head of household is either employed 
(working  a  minimum  average  of  sixty  (60)  hours  per  month)  or  is  enrolled  in  and 
scheduled  to  complete  within  four  (4)  months,  a  training  program  approved  by  the 
Department  of  Human  Services  that  has  a  placement  rate  of  at  least  seventy  percent 
(70%). 
 
Payment rate tables will be established to determine grant amounts as follows: 

For each household size, up to eight (8) persons, multiply the maximum allowable gross 
annual income, as defined in § 44-3.A by 0.35. 

The  first  income  range  in  each  table  shall  be  determined  by  multiplying  0.65  times  the 
maximum allowable gross annual income established for each household size; as defined 
in  §  44-3.A.  To  determine  the  amount  of  each  subsequent  income  range  divide  the 
amount determined in § 44-3.A above by one (1) less than the total number of payment 
rate ranges for each size household: 

Household Size 
1 to 4 
5 to 6 
7 plus 

Number of Ranges 
13 
14 
15 

Households  whose  income  is  0.65  times  the  established  maximum  income  level  or  less 
shall  have a payment rate factor of 0.60. Each range above this income level shall have 
this factor reduced by 0.03. 

Supplemental payment. A rent-income ratio  for each applicant  shall be computed in the 
following manner to determine eligibility for the supplemental payments:

Determine  the  "rent-income  ratio" by  dividing  the  applicant's  adjusted  rent  by  his  gross 
annual income; 

If  the  applicant's  rent-income  ratio  is  0.43  or  lower,  the  applicant  receives  no 
supplemental payment; and 

If  the  applicant's  rent-income  ratio  is  above  0.43,  the  applicant  shall  receive  a 
supplemental payment equal to the amount by which the adjusted rent exceeds forty-three 
percent (43%) of the applicant's gross annual income; provided, however, that in no event 
shall  a  household  eligible  under  this  program  pay  less  than  thirty  percent  (30%)  of  its 
income for rent. 

Maximum  net  worth.  For  qualifying  renters,  the  total  net  worth  of  the  applicant  and  all  relatives 
residing with the applicant shall not exceed thirty-five thousand dollars ($35,000.00).

A copy of the detailed administrative regulations adopted by the County Manager shall be kept on file as a 
matter  of  public  record  with  a  copy  of  this  chapter.  Such  regulations  may,  among  other  things,  provide  for  the 
establishment of waiting lists and priorities for certain classes of persons (such as, but not limited to, the homeless) 
where  the  County  Manager  or  his  designee  determines  that  budgetary  restraints  make  it  reasonably  necessary  to 
limit  the  number  of  recipients.  Such  regulations  may  also  provide  for  the  reduction  in  the  amount  of  any  class  or 
category of grant provided for in this chapter by up to five percent (5%), under terms and conditions set forth in the 
regulations,  where  the  County  Manager  or  his  designee  determines  that  budgetary  restraints  make  it  reasonably 
necessary to limit the amount of the grants in order to serve a larger number of recipients.
