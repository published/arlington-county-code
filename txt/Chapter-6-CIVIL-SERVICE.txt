§ 6-13. Employee/Employer Relations. 
 

A.  

Purpose. The sole underlying purpose of both the  County and the employees of the  County is to 
serve and protect the interests of the citizenry of the County. Such interests are best served and protected only when

recognized  that  the  paramount  interests  of  the  citizenry  create  an  employment  relationship  in  the  public  sector 
inherently  different  from  that  which  exists  in  private  employment.  It  is,  therefore,  the  purpose  of  this  policy  to 
provide  guidelines  by  which  management  and  employees  of  the  County  may  hear  and  discuss  matters  concerning 
their employment with the County.
