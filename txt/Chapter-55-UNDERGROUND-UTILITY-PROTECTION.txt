own employees or the employees of another operator it has designated in writing for this 
purpose,  horizontally  locating  its  utility  lines  and  notifying  the  contractor  that  the 
proposed  excavation  will  not  affect  its  existing  utility  lines.  Horizontal  location  means

Horizontal  location  of  utility  lines  at  the  site  of  excavation  shall  consist  of  a  durable  marking 
system approved by the Office of Pipeline Safety or the U.S. Department of Transportation or the 
State Corporation Commission of Virginia; or a locating system approved by the County Manager

tape, or similarly effective device, shall be installed after tampering eighteen (18) inches above all 
direct burial plastic mains and twelve (12) inches above services, stubs and stub extensions. The 
tape shall be not less than three (3) inches wide, brilliant in color and imprinted with words clearly

equipment can readily pick it up. The remainder of the backfill may then be placed.

times through the use of a two-way radio system or some other means approved by the Chief Fire 
Marshal of Arlington County.  

When any person damages a utility line, or the protective coating thereof, or accidentally exposes 
or severs a utility line during excavation or demolition, an emergency shall be deemed to exist and 
the operator of such utility line shall be directly notified at that time.  

When  any  gas  or  flammable  liquid  utility  line  is  severed,  or  damaged  to  the  extent  that  there  is 
escapement of its contents, a hazard shall be deemed to exist and the operator of such utility line 
and the Arlington County Fire Alarm Headquarters shall be immediately notified.  

Contractors shall display in plain sight on the instrument or control panel, or dash of all trucks and 
mechanized equipment operated by them, the current telephone number(s) which is to be utilized 
to give notice as required in subsection A.3 above.

located on the approved site plan, subdivision plan, or engineering plan which is to be at the site 
during excavation or demolition as required by § 55-5.C.3 of this chapter.  

It shall be unlawful to backfill around a damaged utility line, as described in subsections A.2 and 
A.3 above, until the operator of that utility line has been notified of such incident, has repaired the 
damage and/or has given clearance to backfill in writing.  

During  an  emergency  or  hazard,  prudent  work  to  relieve  the  emergency  or  hazard  may  be 
undertaken by the contractor with the permission of the operator, after notice has given as required 
in subsections A.2 and A.3. 

The operator.  

All operators shall make available on a twenty-four (24) hour basis adequate emergency response 
crew(s) including answering personnel, radio dispatchers, appliance servicemen and utility repair 
crews  capable  of  performing  all  work  tasks  necessary  to  cope  with  emergencies  or  hazards. The 
number of emergency work crews shall be determined by the operator based upon the number and 
frequency  of  experiences  recorded  and  a  reasonable  response  time  to  the  site  of  the  emergency 
during other than working hours as determined by the County Manager.  

All hazards reported to operators shall be reported by them immediately to Arlington County Fire 
Alarm Headquarters.

involved shall notify the Arlington County Fire Department to take necessary safety precautions to 
protect the area affected until the utility operator can respond.  

Only the appropriate utility line representatives shall be permitted to reopen any valve or breaker 
which was closed during such a hazard and only after a thorough investigation has indicated that it 
is safe to place the affected lines back into service.  

During  any  emergency  or  hazard,  prudent  work  to  relieve  the  emergency  or  hazard  may  be
