§ 60-17. Enforcement, Violations and Penalties.   
 

A. 

If the Administrator determines that there is a failure to comply with the VSMP authority permit 
conditions or determines there is an unauthorized discharge associated with a land disturbing activity, notice shall be 
served  upon  the  permittee  or  person  responsible  for  carrying  out  the  permit  conditions  by  any  of  the  following: 
verbal warnings and inspection reports, notices to comply, notice of violation, and consent special orders.   

 
B. 

Notices to comply, notice of violation, and consent special orders shall be served by registered or 
certified mail to the address specified in the permit application or by delivery at the site of the development activities 
to the agent or employee supervising such activities. 
 

(1) 

 The  notice  shall  specify  the  measures  needed  to  comply  with  the  permit  conditions  and  shall 
specify the time within which such measures shall be completed. Upon failure to comply within the time specified, a 
stop  work  order  may  be  issued  in  accordance  with  Subsection  B(2)  or  the  permit  may  be  revoked  by  the 
Administrator. 

 
(2) 

If a permittee or person responsible for carrying out the permit conditions fails to comply with a 
notice  issued  in  accordance  with  this  Section  within  the  time  specified,  the  Administrator  may  issue  a  stop  work 
order requiring the owner, permittee, person responsible for carrying out an approved plan, or the person conducting 
the land-disturbing activities without an approved plan or required permit to cease all land-disturbing activities until 
the  violation  of  the  permit  has  ceased,  or  an  approved  plan  and  required  permits  are  obtained,  and  specified 
corrective  measures  have  been  completed.    Such  orders  shall  become  effective  upon  service  on  the  person  by 
certified mail, return receipt requested, sent to his address specified in the land records of the locality, or by personal 
delivery  by  an  agent  of  the  Administrator.    Failure  to  comply  with  a  stop  work  order  shall  constitute  a  separate 
violation of this chapter.   

 
(3) 

 If the Administrator finds that any such violation is grossly affecting or presents an imminent and 
substantial danger of causing harmful erosion of lands or sediment deposition in waters within the watersheds of the 
Commonwealth or otherwise substantially impacting water quality, it may issue, without advance notice or hearing, 
an  emergency  order  directing  such  person  to  cease  immediately  all  land-disturbing  activities  on  the  site  and  shall 
provide  an  opportunity  for  a  hearing,  after  reasonable  notice  as  to  the  time  and  place  thereof,  to  such  person,  to 
affirm, modify, amend, or cancel such emergency order.  If a person who has been issued an order is not complying 
with  the  terms  thereof,  the  Administrator  may  institute  a  proceeding  for  an  injunction,  mandamus,  or  other 
appropriate remedy in accordance with this section. 
 

C. 

It is unlawful and constitutes a separate violation of this Chapter for any person to fail to comply with 
any  stop  work  order,  emergency  order,  or  a  special  order  issued  in  accordance  with  this  chapter.    Any  person 
violating  or  failing,  neglecting,  or  refusing  to  obey  any  rule,  regulation,  ordinance,  order,  approved  standard  or 
specification, or any permit condition issued by the  Administrator  may be compelled in  a proceeding instituted in 
the  Circuit  Court  of  Arlington  County  to  obey  same  and  to  comply  therewith  by  injunction,  mandamus  or  other 
appropriate remedy. 
 

D.  Any person who violates any provision of this chapter or who fails, neglects, or refuses to comply with 
any order of the Administrator, shall be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $32,500 for each violation within the 
discretion of the court.  Each day of violation of each requirement shall constitute a separate offense. 
 

(1) 

Violations  for  which  a  penalty  may  be  imposed  under  this  Subsection  shall  include  but  not  be 

limited to the following:  

a. No state permit registration; 
b. No SWPPP; 
c. Incomplete SWPPP; 
d. SWPPP not available for review; 
e. No approved erosion and sediment control plan; 
f. Failure to install stormwater BMPs or erosion and sediment controls; 
g. Stormwater BMPs or erosion and sediment controls improperly installed or maintained; 
h. Operational deficiencies;

i. Failure to conduct required inspections; 
j. Incomplete, improper, or missed inspections; and 
k. Discharges not in compliance with the requirements of Section 9VAC25-880-70 of the 
General permit. 

(2) 

The Administrator may issue a summons for collection of the civil penalty and the action may be 

prosecuted in the appropriate court. 
 

(3) 

In imposing a civil penalty pursuant to this Subsection, the court may consider the degree of harm 

caused by the violation and also the economic benefit to the violator from noncompliance. 
 

(4) 

Any civil penalties assessed by a court as a result of a summons issued by the County shall be paid 
into the treasury of Arlington County to be used for the purpose of minimizing, preventing, managing, or mitigating 
pollution of the waters of the locality and abating environmental pollution therein in such manner as the court may, 
by order, direct. 
 

E. 

Notwithstanding  any  other  civil  or  equitable  remedy  provided  by  this  Section  or  by  law,  any 
person  who  willfully  or  negligently  violates  any  provision  of  this  chapter,  any  order  of  the  Administrator,  any 
condition of a permit, or any order of a court shall, be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by confinement in jail for 
not more than 12 months or a fine of not less than $2,500 nor more than $32,500, or both. 
(Ord. No. 14-05, 5-10-14, effective 7-1-14) 
 
 
§ 60-18. Performance Bond.  
 

Prior to issuance of any permit, the Applicant may be required to submit a reasonable performance bond 

with surety, cash escrow, letter of credit, any combination thereof, or such other legal arrangement acceptable to the 
County Attorney to ensure that measures could be taken by Arlington County at the Applicant's expense should he 
fail, after proper notice, within the time specified to initiate or maintain appropriate actions which may be required 
of him by the permit conditions as a result of his land disturbing activity.  If Arlington County takes such action 
upon such failure by the Applicant, the County may collect from the Applicant for the difference should the amount 
of the reasonable cost of such action exceed the amount of the security held, if any.  Within 60 days of the 
completion of the requirements of the permit conditions, such bond, cash escrow, letter of credit or other legal 
arrangement, or the unexpended or unobligated portion thereof, shall be refunded to the Applicant or terminated. 
(Ord. No. 14-05, 5-10-14, effective 7-1-14) 

 

§ 60-19. Severability.  

 
If  any  provision  of  this  chapter  is  held  to  be  unconstitutional  or  invalid,  such  unconstitutionality  or 

invalidity shall not affect the remaining provisions of this chapter.  
(Ord. No. 14-05, 5-10-14, effective 7-1-14) 
 
 
§ 60-20. Conflict of Chapter.  
 

In  any  case  where  a  provision  of  this  chapter  is  found  to  be  in  conflict  with  any  other  provision  of  the 
Arlington  County  Code  existing  on  the  effective  date  of  this  chapter,  the  provision  which  establishes  the  more 
stringent standard for the promotion and protection of the health and safety of the people shall prevail. In any case 
where a provision of this chapter is found to be in conflict with any other provision of the Arlington County Code 
existing  on  the  effective  date  of  this  chapter  which  establishes  a  less  stringent  standard  for  the  promotion  and 
protection of the health and safety of the people, the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed to prevail, and such 
other provisions are hereby declared to be repealed to the extent that they may be found in conflict with this chapter.
