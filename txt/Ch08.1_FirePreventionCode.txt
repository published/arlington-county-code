hazardous materials.  The vehicle may be detained long enough to determine if the permits required for transporting 
hazardous materials have been obtained, if the cargo is secure, and if the observed condition, or characteristic, 
presents an immediate threat of a transportation related spill and/or a catastrophic event. The hazardous materials 
transportation vehicle may resume operation if it is found to be in good repair and free of leaks, in accordance with

repairs or adjustments are made where it is situated, or it is removed to a safe location, as determined by the fire

operator in all petroleum storage tanks whenever, in the professional judgment of the fire code 
official, there is a possibility that product may be lost by overflowing. These emergency devices 
shall be considered only as auxiliary and supplementary to the use of trained personnel engaged in 
a transfer or fill operation.  
 
When the owner or authorized operator's log book and product inventory records indicate a loss of 
product exceeding one percent (1%) of flow through plus one hundred and thirty (130) gallons, a 
test for tightness on the underground tank shall be performed in accordance with the standards set 
forth in NFPA 329.  The fire code official may also order a test for tightness when, in the 
professional judgment of the fire code official, there is reason or evidence to suspect a loss of 
product.  
 
 
A test for tightness shall be conducted on all storage tanks and/or systems prior to change in 
ownership.  
 
When loss of product is indicated from a storage tank and/or system during any test for tightness, 
the operator and/or person in control and the person conducting the test shall immediately report

REQUIREMENTS FOR A FIRE WATCH 

 
A101.1  Scope.  
 

A fire watch is a temporary measure intended to ensure continuous and systematic surveillance of a 
building, structure or portion thereof by one (1) or more qualified individuals for the purposes of identifying and 
controlling fire hazards, detecting early signs of smoke, unwanted fire, or other hazardous conditions raising an 
alarm of fire and immediately notifying the fire department and the Arlington County Emergency Communications 
Center (ECC).  

 

A102.1  Initiation.  
 

In the event that a fire protection system, sprinkler system, alarm, detection, or other suppression system 
is impaired or out of service, a fire watch shall be instituted by the person in control (as defined in Chapter 8.1 of 
the Arlington County Code, 1957 as amended).  

 

A102.2  Procedures.  
 

When  the  establishment  of  a  fire  watch  is  initiated  by  the  person  in  control,  or  ordered  by  the  fire 
department or fire code official, the owner or the owner’s representative shall implement the following procedures 
for the duration of the fire watch.  The fire watch shall be maintained until such time the noted system(s) is returned 
to normal ready service and approved for use by the fire code official.  

 
1.  A fire watch shall consist of the following:  

 

 

a.  A designated number of staff performing fire watch duties at all times until the fire

     FIRE PREVENTION  

NOTE:  When dialing 9-1-1 from a cellular phone, some cellular phone systems may connect the user with 
another jurisdiction’s emergency communications center, therefore the caller should confirm they are 
speaking with the “Arlington County Emergency Communications Center (ECC).”

or building. 

 

NOTE:  If the building or property is of such size that one (1) individual cannot adequately perform the

participate in the fire watch.   

 
2.   A legibly written log shall be kept on site at all times for review by any fire department  employee 
documenting:  

a.  The reason the fire watch was implemented.  
 
b.  The date and time the fire department was notified the fire watch was initiated and concluded.  
 
c.  The start and stop time of each building or property tour.  
 
d.  The key locations visited in the building(s) requiring the fire watch.

     FIRE PREVENTION  

 
NOTE:  In all cases, the sole duty of personnel assigned to the fire watch shall be to perform constant
