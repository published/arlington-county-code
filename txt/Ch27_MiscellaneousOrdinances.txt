Board on motor vehicles, trailers, semitrailers, and boats ("taxable property") which have a situs in the County on 
January 1 of each year or which acquire a situs in the County on or after January 2. When taxable property acquires a 
situs in the County on or after January 16 and before December 16, the personal property tax for that year shall be 
prorated on a monthly basis. When taxable property with a situs in the County is transferred to a new owner, personal 
property tax will be assessed to the new owner, prorated on a monthly basis for the portion of the tax year during 
which the new owner owns the taxable property. For purposes of proration, a period of more than one-half (1/2) of a 
month shall be counted as a full month and a period of less than one-half (1/2) of a month shall not be counted. The 
value of all taxable property shall be assessed as of January 1 of the tax year. 
 
 
Proration  refunds.  When  any  taxable  property  loses  its  situs  within  the  County  or  its  title  is 
transferred, the taxpayer shall be relieved from personal property tax and receive a refund of personal property tax, 
penalty and interest already paid, prorated on a monthly basis, upon application to the Commissioner of the Revenue, 
provided  that  application  is  made  in  the  manner  provided  by §§  58.1-3516  and  58.1-3980  of  the  Virginia  Code; 
provided,  however,  no  refund  shall  be  made  if  the  motor  vehicle,  trailer,  or  boat  acquires  a  situs  within  the 
Commonwealth in a nonprorating locality during the tax year. No interest shall be paid on refunds of prorated taxes.

vehicle, trailer, or boat in all subsequent years in which the Commissioner of the Revenue has not 
been informed of a change in the address or name of the owner of the motor vehicle, trailer, or boat 
or of a change in the  situs or ownership of the  motor vehicle, trailer, or boat. Such owners are 
required to file a new personal property tax return with the Commissioner of the Revenue within 
sixty (60) days of any (i) change in the name or address of the person or persons owning the vehicle;
