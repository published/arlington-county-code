§ 63-3. Collection. 
 
 
It shall be the duty of every service provider in acting as the tax collecting medium or agency for 
Arlington County to collect from the purchaser for the use of Arlington County the tax hereby imposed and levied at 
the time of collecting the purchase price charged therefore and the taxes collected during each calendar month shall 
be reported and paid by each service provider to the Treasurer and the seller shall remit the amount of tax shown by 
said report to the Treasurer on or before the last working day of the first calendar month thereafter, together with the 
name and address of any purchaser who has refused to pay his tax.  
 

Such  taxes  shall  be  paid  by  the  service  provider  to  the  Treasurer,  and  the  service  provider  shall  act  in 
accordance with Virginia Code § 58.1-3814, paragraphs F, G, H, and I, and Virginia Code § 58.1-2901. Any tax 
paid by the consumer to the service provider shall be deemed to be held in trust by such provider until remitted to 
the Treasurer.  

 
If any consumer fails to pay a bill issued by a service provider, including the taxes imposed by this chapter, 
the service provider shall follow its normal collection procedures and upon collection of the bill or any part thereof 
shall apportion the net amount collected between the charge for utility service and the tax and remit the tax portion 
to this jurisdiction. 

 
Bills shall be considered as monthly bills for the purposes of this chapter if submitted twelve (12) 
times per year of approximately one (1) month each. Accordingly, the tax for a bi-monthly bill (approximately sixty 
(60)  days)  shall  be  determined  as  follows:  (i)  the  CCF  will  be  divided  by  two  (2);  (ii)  a  monthly  tax  will  be 
calculated using the rates set forth above; (iii) the tax determined by (ii) shall be multiplied by two (2); (iv) the tax in 
(iii) may not exceed twice the monthly "maximum tax."

§ 63-4. Records to be Kept by the Seller.  
 

Each  and  every  seller  shall  keep  complete  records  showing  all  purchases  in  Arlington  County,  which 
records shall show the price charged against each purchaser with respect to each purchase, the date of purchase, the 
date of payment, and the amount of tax imposed, and such records shall be kept open for inspection by the duly 
authorized agents of Arlington County who shall have the right, power and authority to make such copies thereof

Any consumer of electricity or natural gas failing, refusing or neglecting to pay the tax hereby levied, and 
any officer, agent or employee of any seller service provider violating the provisions hereof shall, upon conviction, 
be subject to penalty not to exceed those prescribed by general law for a Class 3 misdemeanor if the amount of tax 
due is one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or less, or a Class 1 misdemeanor if the amount of the tax due is more than 
one  thousand  dollars  ($1,000.00).  Each  failure,  refusal,  neglect  or  violation  and  each  day's  continuance  shall
