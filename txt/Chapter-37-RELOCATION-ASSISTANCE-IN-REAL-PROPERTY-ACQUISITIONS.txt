replacement dwelling.  Such amount shall be paid only if the dwelling acquired by the County was 
encumbered by a bona  fide  mortgage  which  was a valid lien, on such dwelling  for  not less than 
one  hundred  eighty  (180)  days  prior  to  the  initiation  of  negotiations  for  the  acquisition  of  such 
dwelling.  Such amount shall be equal to the excess in the aggregate interest and other debt service 
costs of that amount of the principal of the mortgage on the replacement dwelling which is equal 
to  the  unpaid  balance  of  the  mortgage  on  the  acquired  dwelling,  over  the  remainder  term  of  the

dwelling, or on the date on which such person moves from the acquired dwelling, whichever is the later date.
