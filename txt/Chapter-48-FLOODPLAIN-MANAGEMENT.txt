FLOODPLAIN DISTRICT 

 
§ 48-47. Establishment of the Floodplain District.  
 

The floodplain district shall include all areas subject to inundation by the  waters of the one hundred-year 
flood.  The  source  of  this  delineation  shall  be  the  Flood  Insurance  Study  (FIS)  and  the  Flood  Insurance  Rate  Map 
(FIRM)  for  Arlington  County,  Virginia,  as  prepared  by  the  Federal  Emergency  Management  Agency  (FEMA), 
Federal Insurance Administration (FIA),  Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) 515520 0017, 0018, 0019, 0036, 0038,

The boundaries of the SFHA Districts are established as shown on the FIRM which is declared to be a part 

Code Updated 7-2013 
 

 

 

of this chapter and which shall be kept on file at the Arlington County offices. 

 

 
A. 

 
The Floodway District is in an AE zone and is delineated, for the purpose of this chapter, using the 
criterion  that  certain  areas  within  the  floodplain  must  be  capable  of  carrying  the  waters  of  the  one  percent  annual 
chance  of  flood  without  increasing  the  water  surface  elevation  of  that  flood  more  than  (1)  foot  at  any  point.  The 
following provisions shall apply within the Floodway District of an AE zone: 

 
1.        Within  any  floodway  area,  no  encroachments,  including  fill,  new  construction,  substantial 
improvements, or other development shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic 
and  hydraulic  analysis  performed  in  accordance  with  standard  engineering  practice  that  the  proposed 
encroachment  will  not  result  in  any  increase  in  flood  levels  within  the  Arlington  County  during  the 
occurrence  of  the  base  flood  discharge.  Hydrologic  and  hydraulic  analyses  shall  be  undertaken  only  by 
professional engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods 
used correctly reflect currently-accepted technical concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be 
submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough review by the Floodplain Administrator. 

 

2. 
 Development  activities  which  increase  the  water  surface  elevation  of  the  base  flood  may  be 
allowed,  provided  that  the  applicant  first  applies  –  with  Arlington  County’s  endorsement  –  for  a 
Conditional  Letter  of  Map  Revision  (CLOMR),  and  receives  the  approval  of  the  Federal  Emergency 
Management Agency. 
 

 
       B. 

 
The  AE  Zone  on  the  FIRM  accompanying  the  FIS  shall  be  those  areas  for  which  one-percent 
 
annual  chance  flood  elevations  have  been  provided  and  the  floodway  has  not  been  delineated.    The  following 
provisions shall apply within an AE zone: 
 

 Until  a  regulatory  floodway  is  designated,  no  new  construction,  substantial  improvements,  or 
1. 
other development (including fill) shall be permitted within the areas of special flood hazard, designated as 
Zone AE on the FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, 
when  combined  with  all  other  existing  and  anticipated  development,  will  not  increase  the  water  surface 
elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point within the Arlington County. 

 

 

2. 
 Development activities in Zone AE on Arlington County's FIRM which increase the water surface 
elevation  of  the  base  flood  by  more  than  one  (1)  foot  may  be  allowed,  provided  that  the  applicant  first 
applies –  with  Arlington County’s endorsement – for a Conditional  Letter of Map Revision, and receives 
the approval of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 

             C.   
The A Zone on the FIRM accompanying the FIS shall be those areas for which no detailed flood 
profiles  or  elevations  are  provided,  but  the  one  percent  annual  chance  floodplain  boundary  has  been  approximated.  
For these areas, the following provisions shall apply: 

 

 

1. 
The Approximated Floodplain shall be that floodplain area for which no detailed flood profiles or 
elevations are provided, but where a one hundred (100)-year floodplain boundary has been approximated. 
Such  areas  are  shown  as  Zone  A  on  the  maps  accompanying  the  FIS.  For  these  areas,  the  base  flood 
elevations and floodway information from federal, state, and other acceptable sources shall be used, when 
available. Where the specific one percent (1%) annual chance flood elevation cannot be determined for this 
area  using  other  sources  of  data,  such  as  the  U.  S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  Floodplain  Information 
Reports, U. S. Geological Survey Flood-Prone Quadrangles, etc., then the applicant for the proposed use, 
development  and/or  activity  shall  determine  this  base  flood  elevation.  For  development  proposed  in  the 
approximate  floodplain  the  applicant  must  use  technical  methods  that  correctly  reflect  currently  accepted 
non-detailed  technical  concepts,  such  as  point  on  boundary,  high  water  marks,  or  detailed  methodologies 
hydrologic  and  hydraulic  analyses.  Studies,  analyses,  computations,  etc.,  shall  be  submitted  in  sufficient 
detail to allow a thorough review by the Floodplain Administrator. 

2. 
The Floodplain Administrator reserves the right to require a hydrologic and hydraulic analysis for 
any development.  When such base flood elevation data is utilized, the lowest floor shall be elevated to or 

Code Updated 7-2013 
 

 

 

 

 

above  one  foot  above  the  base  flood  level.    During  the  permitting  process,  the  Floodplain  Administrator 
shall obtain: 

 

a.          The  elevation  of  the  lowest  floor  (including  the  basement)  of  all  new  and  substantially 
improved structures; and  

b.        
the elevation to which the structure has been flood-proofed. 

if the structure has been flood-proofed in accordance with the requirements of this article, 

c.     Base flood elevation data shall be obtained from other sources or developed using detailed 
methodologies  comparable  to  those  contained  in  a  FIS  for  subdivision  proposals  and  other 
proposed  development  proposals  (including  manufactured  home  parks  and  subdivisions)  that 
exceed fifty lots or five acres, whichever is the lesser. 

 
 
identified as AO on the FIRM.  For these areas, the following provisions shall apply: 

        D.   

The  AO  Zone  on  the  FIRM  accompanying  the  FIS  shall  be  those  areas  of  shallow  flooding 

 

 

1.  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures shall have the lowest floor, 
including  basement,  elevated  to  or  above  the  flood  depth  specified  on  the  FIRM,  above  the  highest 
adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet  on the FIRM.  If no flood depth 
number is specified, the lowest  floor, including basement,  shall be elevated no less than two (2) feet 
above the highest adjacent grade.  

2.  All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential structures shall 

 

 

a. 
have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the flood depth specified on 
the FIRM, above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet 
on the FIRM.  If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be 
elevated at least two (2) feet above the highest adjacent grade; or 
 
b. 
together  with  attendant  utility  and  sanitary  facilities  be  completely  flood-proofed  to  the 
specified  flood  level  so  that  any  space  below  that  level  is  watertight  with  walls  substantially 
impermeable  to  the  passage  of  water  and  with  structural  components  having  the  capability  of 
resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. 

c.  Adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes shall be provided to guide floodwaters 
around and away from proposed structures.

Services  or  his  designee  with  respect  to  the  interpretation  of  the  provisions  of  this  chapter  (except  part  A  of  this 
section), that person shall be entitled to appeal for a waiver of that decision. Such appeal must be made in writing to 
the  County  Manager  of  Arlington  County  or  his  designee  within  thirty  (30)  days  after  the  decision  as  set  forth 
below. 
 
Waivers.  Whenever  any  person  is  aggrieved  by  a  decision  of  the  Director  of  Environmental 
 
Services  or  his  designee  with  respect  to  the  interpretation  of  the  provisions  of  this  chapter  (except  part  A  of  this 
section), that person shall be entitled to apply for a waiver of that decision to the County Manager. Such application 
must be made in writing to the County Manager of Arlington County or his designee within thirty (30) days after the 
decision as set forth below. 
 
 
 Waivers  shall  be  issued  only  upon  (i)  a  showing  of  good  and  sufficient  cause,  (ii)  after  the  County 
Manager or his designee  has determined that failure to grant the waiver would result in exceptional hardship to the 
applicant, and (iii) after the County Manager or his designee has determined that the granting of such waiver will not 
result  in  (a)  unacceptable  or  prohibited  increases  in  flood  heights,  (b)  additional  threats  to  public  safety,  (c) 
extraordinary public expense; and will not (d) create nuisances, (e) cause fraud or victimization of the public, or (f) 
conflict with local laws or ordinances. 
 

C.  

In  reviewing  applications  for  waivers,  the  County  Manager  of  Arlington  County  or  his  designee  shall 
examine  all  relevant  factors  and  procedures  specified  in  other  ordinances  and  consider  the  following  applicable 
factors: 
 
  

The  danger  to  life  and  property  due  to  increased  flood  heights  or  velocities  caused  by 
encroachments. No waiver shall be granted for any proposed use, development, or activity within 
any floodway district that will cause any increase in the one hundred-year flood elevation.

The  proposed  water  supply  and  sanitation  systems  and  the  ability  of  these  systems  to  prevent 
disease, contamination, and unsanitary conditions. 

The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such 
damage on the individual owners. 

The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the Arlington County. 

The requirements of the facility for a waterfront location. 

The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding for the proposed use. 

The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and development anticipated in 
the foreseeable future. 

The relationship of the proposed use to the Arlington County Comprehensive Plan and Floodplain 
Management Program for the area.

12. 

The  expected  heights,  velocity,  duration,  rate  of  rise,  and  sediment  transport  of  the  flood  waters 
expected at the site. 

The repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or 
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a  historic structure and the 
variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 

13. 

Such other factors which are relevant to the purposes of this chapter.  

The  County  Manager  of  Arlington  County  or  his  designee  may  refer  any  application  and  accompanying 
documentation  pertaining  to  any  request  for  a  waiver  to  any  engineer  or  other  qualified  person  or  agency  for 
technical assistance, at the cost of the applicant, in evaluating the proposed project in relation to flood heights and 
velocities and the adequacy of the plans for flood protection and other related matters.  

 
Waivers may be issued only after the County Manager of Arlington County or his designee has determined 
that the  waiver  will be the  minimum deviation, as determined by the  County  Manager of Arlington  County or his 
designee, from the requirements necessary to provide relief from hardship to the applicant.  

 
The  County  Manager  of  Arlington  County  or  his  designee  shall  notify  the  applicant  in  writing  that  the 
issuance of the waiver to construct a structure below the one hundred-year flood elevation (a) increases the risks to 
life and property and (b) will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance. A record shall be maintained by 
the Director of Environmental Services of the above notification as well as all waiver actions, including justification 
for  the  issuance  of  the  waivers.  Any  waivers  which  are  issued  shall  be  noted  in  the  annual  or  biennial  report 
submitted to the Federal Insurance Administrator.

§ 48-66. County Liability.  
 
 
The  degree  of  flood  protection  sought  by  the  provisions  of  this  chapter  is  considered  reasonable  for 
regulatory  purposes  and  is  based  on  acceptable  engineering  methods  of  study,  but  does  not  imply  total  flood 
protection.    Larger  floods  may  occur  on  rare  occasions.    Flood  heights  may  be  increased  by  man-made  or  natural 
causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This chapter does not imply that districts outside 
the Floodplain District or land uses permitted within such district will be free from flooding or flood damages. 
 

This chapter shall not create liability on the part of Arlington County or any officer or employee thereof for 
any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
