such  sheriffs and other officers and others acting by their  authority, or the authority of  any of them,  shall be  held 
guiltless;  provided,  such  killing,  maiming  or  injury  shall  take  place  in  consequence  of  the  use  of  necessary  and 
proper means to disperse or apprehend any such persons so riotously or unlawfully assembled.
