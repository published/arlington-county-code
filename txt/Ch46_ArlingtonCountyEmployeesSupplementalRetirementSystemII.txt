A. 

(2-8-81) 
 
§ 46-12. Same--Composition; Organization and Terms of Office. 
 
 
The  Board  shall  consist  of  seven  (7)  trustees  as  follows:    Three  (3)  trustees  appointed  by  the 
County  Board;  one  (1)  trustee  appointed  by  the  County  Manager;  one  (1)  trustee  who  is  an  active  employee  and 
member of the Arlington County Retirement System elected by police officers, firefighters and deputy sheriffs; one 
(1) trustee who is currently receiving retirement benefits from the Arlington County Retirement System elected by 
the  retired  members.;  and  one  (1)  trustee  who  is  an  active  employee  and  member  of  the  Arlington  County 
Retirement System elected by employees not represented by another elected trustee.  The election of the trustees by 
the  employees  of  the  County  and  retirees  shall  be  conducted  under  procedural  rules  approved  by  the  County 
Manager.   Notwithstanding the above, the  County  Manager  may  forego an election of trustee or  substitute if only 
one (1) eligible person is nominated by the employees for an office pursuant to procedures adopted by the  County 
Manager.    The  person  nominated  shall  be  deemed  elected.    If  no  eligible  employee  or  retiree  is  nominated,  the 
County Manager shall appoint an eligible employee or retiree to serve as a trustee, as applicable.   
 

B. 

The term of office of the trustees shall be four (4) years, except that when the  Board of Trustees 
shall be so created and constituted, the trustee to be appointed by the  County Manager and the trustee to be elected 
by  police  officers,  firefighters  and  deputy  sheriffs  shall  be  appointed  or  elected  for  an  initial  two-year  term.  
Subsequent terms of such trustees shall be for four (4) years.  Terms shall date from the effective date of this article.  
If an elected trustee or a substitute trustee elected after November 1, 2000  to represent police officers, firefighters, 
deputy sheriffs or other employees ceases to be an active employee and member of the Arlington County Retirement 
System, that trustee shall forfeit the office. 
 
 
When  such  Board  shall  be  so  created  and  constituted  it  shall  at  its  first  meeting,  and  annually 
thereafter,  elect  one  (1) of  its  members  as  president,  one  (1)  as  vice-president,  one  (1) as  secretary,  and  appoint  a 
treasurer, who may or may not be a trustee. 
 

C.  

D. 

There  shall  be  elected  one  (1)  substitute  trustee,  who  is  an  active  employee  and  member  of  the 
Arlington County Retirement System, for each trustee who is elected by the police officers, firefighters and deputy 
sheriffs;  and  one  (1)  substitute  trustee  elected  by  other  employees;  and  one  (1)  substitute  trustee  who  is  currently 
receiving retirement benefits from the Arlington County Retirement System elected by retirees of the System.  Each 
person  so  elected  must  be  a  member  of  the  group  the  person  is  elected  to  represent.    Each  substitute  trustee  shall 
serve in the absence of the trustee and shall be authorized to act on all matters in which the trustee may act.  Each 
substitute trustee’s term of office shall coincide with the term of office of the trustee for whom he is a substitute.  If 
the trustee for whom he is a substitute resigns or otherwise vacates the position, the substitute trustee shall become a 
trustee and an election shall be conducted for a new substitute trustee.  No eligible person can be nominated for both 
a trustee and a substitute trustee simultaneously. 
 

E. 

The successors to the trustees and the substitute trustees shall be selected thirty (30) days before 
the expiration of the term of office. For trustees or substitute trustees elected or appointed after February 2009, their 
terms  of  office  will  end  on  January  31.    The  successors  shall  take  office  during  the  regularly  scheduled  February 
Board meeting.  
 
 
Each  member  of  the  Board  shall  be  entitled  to  one  (1)  vote.  Four  (4)  trustees  shall  constitute  a 
quorum  provided  that  no  decision  of  the  trustees  shall  be  effective  unless  four  (4)  trustees  have  voted  in  favor  of 
such decision.

rendered while a member of the System after he becomes a member, or after he last became a member in the 
event  of  a  break  in  his  membership,  and  for  the  period  he  is  on  service-connected  disability  retirement.  Each 
member shall receive membership service credit for military leave, provided that the member returns to work in 
accordance  with  the  Uniformed  Services  Employment  and  Reemployment  Rights  Act  (USERRA)  and  the 
member’s discharge is not under dishonorable conditions. This membership service credit will be applicable to

(5)  years  as  defined  by  USERRA.  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  in  this  chapter  to  the  contrary, 
contributions,  benefits  and  creditable  service  with  respect  to  qualified  military  service  will  be  provided  in 
accordance with Internal Revenue Code § 414(u), effective October 13, 1996 or any other applicable law. 
 

B.  Prior Service Credit.  An employee who becomes a member after re-employment and after having withdrawn 
the  accumulated  contributions  contributed  during  his  prior  membership  may  re-establish  his  membership

1. 

If such employee were a former member of this System, by repayment to the System of the amount of his 
withdrawn accumulated contributions, with interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the date 
of withdrawal, which shall be a lump sum payment, plan-to-plan transfer, payroll contributions for a period 
not to exceed one (1) year (if offered by Employer) or a combination of these options.  
 
If  such  employee  were  a  former  member  of  the  Arlington  County  Employees'  Supplemental  Retirement 
System (Chapter 21) or the Arlington County School Board Employees' Supplemental Retirement System 
(Chapter  35),  by  contributing  to  this  System  the  applicable  employee  contribution  based  upon  the 
employee's compensation during the credit period sought and the contribution rate in effect for this System, 
with interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the date of withdrawal, which shall be a lump 
sum payment.  
 

2. 

3.  An official purchasing service pursuant to § 46-27.B shall pay their contributions plus interest at the rate of 
six  percent  (6%)  per  annum  for  each  full  calendar  year  in  which  the  contributions  were  not  assets  of  the 
fund. The payment shall be made in a lump sum.  
 

C.  Additional Permissive Service Credit.  While an employee, a member of the System may purchase up to four 

(4) years of service credit, provided the following requirements are met:

Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard or reserve components and the employee was not 
discharged under dishonorable conditions; or 
 

ii.  prior local government service; or 

 

iii.  prior public safety officer service (police officer, deputy sheriff, firefighter or a National 
Registry or state certified emergency medical technician or higher) with a federal, state, 
municipal or local governmental employer; however, only public safety officer service as 
described  in  Internal  Revenue  Code  Section  415(b)(2)(H)(ii)(I)  will  be  excluded  from 
Internal Revenue Code maximum benefit limitations. 
 

2.  No service credit may be purchased under this section if it is included in the calculation of any  retirement 
allowance received or to be received by the member from this or another retirement system.  Service in the 
U.S. Armed Forces Reserves or the National Guard is exempt from this requirement. 
 

3.  The  amount  of  membership  service  credit  purchased  does  not  exceed  the  lesser  of  four  (4)  years  or  the 

length of employee’s other prior service.

contributions (if offered by Employer) or a combination of these options. 
 

6.  The  County  Manager,  or  designee,  has  the  authority  to  adopt  rules  and  procedures  governing  the 

administration of service credit purchases.  

  
D.  At the time of retirement, an employee hired prior to January 1, 2001, may elect to convert an unlimited amount 
of unused sick leave to service credit, in lieu of any cash payment provided by the County for accumulated sick

January 1, 2001, may only receive service credit for accumulated sick leave.

accrued and unused vacation, and any earned and unused compensatory time paid at employment termination as 
determined by the County Board. In the event that an employer does not pay the established contribution, the Board 
shall take appropriate action to secure payment. 
 
 
The annual employer contribution rate for this chapter, Chapter 21, and Chapter 35 shall be fixed 
as equal to the employer normal cost plus an expense rate plus any amortization charges from subsection C below, if 
the System's funding ratio (actuarial value of assets divided by actuarial accrued liability) remains within a corridor, 
the  lower  measurement  of  which  is  one  hundred  percent  (100%)  and  the  upper  measurement  of  which  is  one 
hundred  and  twenty  percent  (120%). The  employer  normal  cost  and  actuarial  accrued  liability  are  to  be  measured 
using the method recommended by an actuary and approved by the Retirement Board.   

 

In  the  fiscal  year  commencing  June  30,  1986,  the  employer  shall  transmit  to  the  System  on  January  15, 
1987, a sum equal to one-half (1/2) the actual annual contribution for the first six (6) months of the fiscal year. On 
May  15,  1987,  the  employer  shall  transmit  to  the  system  a  sum  equal  to  one-quarter  (1/4)  the  actual  annual 
contribution for the third quarter of the fiscal year. On August 15, 1987, the employer shall transmit to the  System a 
sum equal  to one-quarter (1/4) the actual annual contribution for the  fourth quarter of the fiscal  year commencing 
June 30, 1986. The August 15 transmittal shall be adjusted to reflect the full annual contribution due based on actual 
payroll and any actuarial estimate of loss of income by reason of timing of payments.  

 

On  October  15  of  each  subsequent  fiscal  year,  the  employer  shall  transmit  to  the  System  a  sum  equal  to 
one-quarter (1/4) the actual annual contribution for the first quarter of the fiscal year. On January 15 of each fiscal 
year, the employer shall transmit to the  System a sum equal to one-quarter (1/4) the actual annual contribution for 
the second quarter of the fiscal year. On May 15 of each fiscal year, the employer shall transmit to the System a sum 
equal to one-quarter (1/4) the actual annual contribution for the third quarter of the fiscal year. On August 15 of the 
succeeding fiscal year, the employer shall transmit to the System a sum equal to one-quarter (1/4) the actual annual 
contribution for the fourth quarter of the previous fiscal year. The August 15 transmittal shall be adjusted to reflect 
the full annual contribution due based on actual payroll. 

 
C.  

In the event of an ordinance  change that affects benefits, the employer contribution rate shall be 
changed  effective  with  the  July  1  coincident  with  or  next  following  the  date  of  adoption  of  the  ordinance  change. 
The  employer  normal  cost  component  shall  be  adjusted  to  the  level  required  by  the  ordinance  change.    If  the 
ordinance change increases benefits, the employer contribution rate shall also be increased effective with the July 1 
coincident with or next following the date of adoption of the ordinance change by a twenty (20) year amortization of 
any  increase  in actuarial liability as a result of the change; however, should the  funding ratio exceed one hundred 
and twenty percent (120%) at any point after the effective date of the benefit change, this amortization payment will 
cease.

Upon service retirement of a member prior to his normal retirement age as provided in § 46-37.B, 

 
the member shall receive an annual retirement allowance, payable monthly to him for life, which shall be equal to

notify the County of his election: (i) commencing on his early retirement date  or the first of any subsequent month 
prior to his normal retirement age but reduced by one-half of one percent (0.5%) for each full month by which the 
receipt of his monthly allowance precedes the earlier of (a) his normal retirement date, or (b) the first date on which 
his number of years of service and his attained age  would have equaled the  minimum age and completed  years of 
service requirement provided in § 46-37.A had he been continuously in service from his date of retirement until such 
first date; or (ii) commencing at his normal retirement date without such reduction. 
 
 
The retirement allowance for service retirement under the provisions of  § 46-38 shall be reduced 
by any compensation awarded to the member or retiree under the Virginia Workers' Compensation Act ("the Act"), 
whether such award is paid to the member or retiree in a lump sum or otherwise. Such reduction shall be made only 
for  compensation  awarded  to  cover  any  period  of  time  for  which  the  member  or  retiree  is  or  will  be  receiving 
benefits  under  §  46-38.  No  such  reduction  shall  be  made  for  compensation  awarded  for  permanent  partial  or 
permanent total loss or disfigurement, where payments are made from the schedule of payments provided for such 
under  the  Act.  For  purposes  of  this  section,  compensation  awarded  does  not  include  reimbursement  for  medical 
expenses. 
 
 
Any member not entering the DROP and electing a normal, early or a deferred benefit may, at the 
time the member chooses to begin receiving retirement benefits, elect to receive a lump sum payment equal to the 
lesser  of  ten  percent  (10%)  of  the  actuarial  value  equivalent  to  that  of  the  annual  retirement  allowance,  including 
expected post-retirement  supplements  which  may be payable pursuant to  § 46-49, to  which he could otherwise be 
entitled,  as  determined  by  the  actuary,  of  the  benefits  to  be  paid  over  the  member's  lifetime  or  twenty  thousand 
dollars ($20,000.00). If the then current actuarial value of the benefits is less than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00), 
the entire benefit may be selected as a lump sum. Should the member elect such a lump sum payment, the monthly 
benefit due the retiree  will be reduced by an amount calculated to be equal to the actuarial equivalent of the lump 
sum payment. The lump sum distribution will be issued at the time of the first benefit payment.  
 

D.  

Nothing herein shall be construed to require any person to pay back into the  System any money received 
before  the  effective  date  of  this  section.  No  person  who  has  begun  to  receive  an  allowance  under  §  46-38  before

§ 46-39. Ordinary Disability Retirement. 

 
A.       Any  member  in  service  or  on  authorized  leave  without  pay  who  has  two  (2)  or  more  years  of 
service  and  qualifies  for  Social  Security  disability  retirement  may,  at  any  time  before  his  normal  retirement  date, 
retire  on  account  of  disability  as  herein  defined  upon  written  application  to  the  County  Manager,  made  by  the 
member or his appointing authority, setting forth the date the retirement is to become effective. Such effective date 
shall  be  after  the  last  day  of  service,  and  provided  that  the  medical  advisor,  after  a  medical  examination  of  such 
member,  has  certified  that  (i)  the  member  has  suffered  a  disability,  (ii)  the  disability  has  so  severely  disabled  the 
member  that he is  mentally or physically incapacitated  from performing any substantial, gainful employment, and 
(iii) such disability is likely to be permanent and such member should be retired. Every member granted an ordinary 
disability retirement shall, as a condition of receiving any benefits pursuant to § 46-40, be required to apply for and 
receive Social Security disability benefits.  
 

B.      

Temporary ordinary disability. If, after receiving the member's application for ordinary disability 
retirement,  the  County  Manager  determines  that  all  the  requirements  for  ordinary  disability  retirement  are  met 
except  that  it  has  not  been  determined  whether  the  member  qualifies  for  Social  Security  disability  benefits,  the 
County Manager shall grant to the member a temporary ordinary disability retirement for either a period of time not 
to  exceed  six  (6)  months  or  until  the  member  receives  a  determination  from  the  Social  Security  Administration, 
whichever,  event  occurs  sooner.  If  after  this  six  (6)  month  period,  the  County  Manager  finds  that  the  failure  to 
receive  a  determination  from  the  Social  Security  Administration  was  not  in  any  way  the  fault  of  the  member,  the 
County  Manager  shall  extend  such  member's  temporary  ordinary  disability  retirement.  The  case  of  each  member 
retired pursuant to this subsection B shall then be reviewed by the County Manager at such time as is determined by 
the County Manager.  
 (2-8-81; Ord. No. 83-6, 2-26-83; Ord. No. 00-34, 11-1-00; Ord. No. 04-26, 11-16-04, effective 12-12-04) 
 
§ 46-39.1. Application of State Law.  
 

The  rules  and  regulations  required  by  Chapter  272  of  the  1975  Acts  of  Assembly  and  the  applicable 
sections of the Code of Virginia relating to respiratory disease, hypertension or heart disease of firefighters and the 
hypertension or heart disease of police officers and deputy sheriffs are incorporated herein by reference; provided, 
however, such incorporation by reference shall continue only so long as the enabling legislation requires such rules 
and regulations.  
(Ord. No. 00-34, 11-1-00) 
 
§ 46-40. Ordinary Disability Allowance.  
 

Upon retirement as provided in  § 46-39, a  member shall receive an annual retirement allowance equal to 

the amount calculated in the appropriate sections of § 46-38.A and D with no reduction for early retirement.  
(2-8-81; Ord. No. 00-34, 11-1-00) 
 
§ 46-41. Service-Connected Disability Retirement. 
 
A.       Permanent  disability.  Any  member  in  service  or  on  authorized  leave  without  pay  may  retire  on 
 
account  of  service-connected  disability  that  is  not  due  to  the  employee's  willful  misconduct  if  he  is  permanently 
disabled for duty, upon written application to the County Manager made by the member or his appointing authority, 
setting forth the date the retirement is to become effective. Such effective date shall be after the last day of service.  
 

In the case of a member who is a member of the V.R.S., the County Manager shall accept the determination 
of the Medical Examining Board of the V.R.S. In all other cases, no allowance for retirement may be awarded until 
after the medical advisor has examined the applicant and has certified that (i) the member has suffered a permanent 
disability resulting  from an  injury or occupational disease;  (ii) the disability has rendered the  member  mentally or 
physically incapacitated for the  further performance of the significant duties of  the classification  which  he  held at 
the time of his disability; and (iii) such disability is the natural and proximate result of an accident or injury which 

Code Updated 01-2020 

46-22 

ARLINGTON COUNTY CODE 

 

 RETIREMENT SYSTEM--II 

occurred while in the actual performance of duty at some definite time or place, or such disability  was the natural 
and  proximate  result  of  an  occupational  disease  that  was  contracted  as  a  result  of  exposure  occasioned  by 
employment.  The  medical  advisor  shall  consider  all  medical  information  provided  by  the  Worker's  Compensation 
Office  of  the  County  and  the  Worker's  Compensation  treating  physician  and  will  consult  the  treating  physician  as 
necessary.  No  ordinary  disease  of  life  to  which  the  general  public  is  exposed  outside  of  employment  shall  be  the 
basis  for  retirement  unless  such  disease  is  found  to  be  compensable  under  workers'  compensation  and  the  County 
Manager finds beyond a reasonable doubt that the ordinary disease of life (i) did not result from any cause outside of 
employment and (ii) either:  
 

1.      

Followed as an incident of an occupational disease; or  

 

 

2.     

Resulted  solely,  naturally,  and  unavoidably  from  an  injury  which  occurred  while  in  the  actual 
performance of the member's occupational duties at some definite time and place.  

No allowance shall be awarded unless the County Manager finds that the accident or injury upon which the 
medical advisor based its medical certification occurred, in fact, while the applicant was in the actual performance of 
duty at some definite time or place or the County Manager finds that the exposure upon which the medical advisor 
based its medical certification was occasioned, in fact, by employment.  
 

If  the  medical  advisor's  opinion  disagrees  with  that  of  the  worker's  compensation  treating  physician 

opinion, the County Manager may appoint a substitute medical advisor.  
 

The  phrase  "permanent  disability"  shall  not  be  construed  to  include  a  medical  condition  which  may  be 

corrected if the member follows a reasonable medical treatment plan or reasonable medical advice.  
 

B.     

Temporary  disability.  If,  after  conducting  the  examination,  the  medical  advisor  certifies  that  the 
requirements for permanent disability are met, except that it has not been determined if the disability is permanent, 
or  if  in  the  opinion  of  the  physician  the  disability  may  be  alleviated  or  eliminated  if  the  applicant  follows  a 
reasonable medical treatment plan or reasonable medical advice, the physician shall notify the County Manager in 
writing of his findings, stating his reasons and recommendations. The County Manager  shall direct the  member to 
follow such a plan or advice unless it determines that the risk to the member of the plan or advice is too high or the 
possibility of success too low, given all the facts and circumstances, and the member shall be temporarily retired.  
 

The case of each member retired pursuant to this subsection B shall be reviewed by the County Manager at 
such time as is determined by the County Manager, and if no specific time for review is determined, the member's 
case shall be reviewed by  the County Manager  within twelve (12)  months from the date the temporary retirement 
was granted.  Any person whose disability application is denied or whose temporary disability benefit is terminated, 
may appeal to the board pursuant to § 46-52. 
 

Any  employee  with  a  pre-employment  disability  shall  be  eligible  for  a  service-connected  disability 
allowance  only  if  the  County  Manager  finds  that  such  employee  would  have  been  entitled  to  a  service-connected 
disability allowance notwithstanding the pre-employment disability.

§ 46-42. Service-Connected Disability Allowance. 
 

A.  

Upon retirement as provided in § 46-41, a member shall receive an annual amount equal to sixty-

six and two-thirds percent (66.67%) of the member's average final compensation. 
 

B.  

Upon attaining normal retirement age, the retiree's service-connected disability allowance shall be 
equal to sixty percent (60%) of the member's average final compensation, as used in subsection A above, for police 
officers, firefighters or deputy sheriffs or forty-five percent (45%) of the member's average final compensation for a 
member  who  is  not  a  police  officer,  firefighter  or  deputy  sheriff.  Upon  receiving  Social  Security  benefits,  but  no 
later  than  age  sixty-five  (65),  this  allowance  reduces  to  fifty-two  percent  (52%)  of  the  member's  final  average 
compensation for member's who are police officers, firefighters or deputy sheriffs.

meanings unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:  
 

Definitions.  The following words and terms, when used in this section, shall have the following 

A.  

“Base  salary”  means  an  employee's  base  rate  of  pay  according  to  the  County  Board  adopted  pay  plan, 

including any market adjustments under the pay plan.  

 
“Beneficiary” means, for purposes of § 46-43, that person or persons designated by the member to receive 

life insurance proceeds from the life insurance policy provided or made available by the employer.  

 
“Direct  and  proximate  result”  means  that  result  which  is  the  natural  and  probable  consequence  of  the 

antecedent events.  

 
“Line  of  duty”  means  on  the  job  in  the  service  of  the  member's  employers.    Line  of  duty  does  not  mean 
going to or from work (including between any parking lot or transportation terminal and the employee's work place), 
going to or from meals or breaks, or time spent while "on call" or on stand-by status unless the employee is involved 
in a specific work-related duty during such period.  

 
“Personal injury” means any traumatic injury as well as diseases which  are caused by or result from such 
an  injury,  excluding  occupational  diseases  and  diseases  of  ordinary  life.  The  term  personal  injury  excludes  any 
personal injury caused or contributed to by the intentional misconduct or negligence of the member or beneficiary as 
well  as  suicide.  The  term  personal  injury  also  excludes  any  injury  caused  or  contributed  to  by  the  member's 
consumption of alcohol or illegal drugs.  

 
“Traumatic  injury”  means  a  wound  or  other  condition  of  the  body  caused  by  external  force,  including

chemicals,  electricity,  climatic  conditions,  infectious  diseases,  radiation,  and  bacteria,  but  excluding  stress  and 
strain.  Death  from  heart  attacks,  strokes  and  similar  diseases  resulting  from  chronic,  congenital  or  progressive 
cardiac and/or pulmonary conditions are  not compensable  unless a traumatic injury  was a substantial  factor in the 
death. Heart attacks and stroke shall be presumed to be caused by a traumatic injury  where such heart attacks and 
stroke were substantially caused by arduous and strenuous physical work-related activity. 

 
B.       The  beneficiary  of  any  member  who  dies  in  the  line  of  duty  shall  receive  a  payment  of  two  (2) 
times  the  member's  base  salary  at  the  time  of  death,  up  to  a  maximum  of  one  hundred  fifty  thousand  dollars 
($150,000.00). Such payment may be received by the beneficiary only after the payment is approved by the County 
Manager  as  set  forth  below.  Following  approval  by  the  County  Manager,  the  beneficiary  may  elect  to  receive  the 
payment either in one (1) lump sum or in four (4) equal installments; the first installment to be made after approval 
of the application for payment by the County Manager and the remaining three (3) installments annually thereafter. 
In the event that there is more than one (1) beneficiary no election by beneficiaries is allowed and payment shall be 
of  the  full  payment  only,  divided  between  or  among  the  beneficiaries  in  the  same  manner  which  the  member  has 
designated for the life insurance policy provided by or made available by the employer.  
 

In addition, the member's beneficiary shall receive a benefit equal to the service retirement benefit payable 
under § 46-38 to the member as if the member had worked thirty (30) years for the County. This benefit is payable 
to  the  member's  beneficiary  until  the  member  would  have  reached  normal  retirement  age.  Upon  reaching  normal 
retirement age, the benefit is  equal to the benefit that  would be paid to the survivor had the  member  worked until

 RETIREMENT SYSTEM--II 

normal  retirement,  retired  and  elected  a  one  hundred  percent  (100%)  joint  and  survivor  benefit,  and  died 
immediately.  

 
Additionally, any surviving children, or their legal guardian, shall receive undergraduate tuition assistance 
equal to in-state tuition, room and board at the University of Virginia until the child reaches age twenty-three (23), 
plus thirty-three percent (33%). This benefit is payable in an exact amount as determined by the County Manager on 
a semester by semester basis by submitting the appropriate documentation as determined by the County Manager.  

 
The beneficiary(ies)  may apply  for payment  within one hundred eighty (180) days of the member's death 
by  making  application  to  the  County  Manager.  The  County  Manager  may  adopt  procedures  for  making  and 
evaluating  applications  for  this  benefit.  The  County  Manager  shall  approve  payment  under  this  section  only  after 
finding that the member has died as the direct and proximate result of a personal injury sustained in the line of duty.  
 

Before  approving  any  application,  the  County  Manager  must  receive  a  written  certification  from  the 
medical  advisor  that  the  member  has  died  as  the  direct and  proximate  result  of  a  personal  injury  identified  by  the 
medical advisor and the County’s legal advisor certifies that all the requirements of this section have been met.  
 

The  one  hundred  fifty  thousand  dollar  ($150,000.00)  maximum  established  under  this  section  shall  be 
increased by the same amount as the annual cost of living adjustment made by the Arlington County Board for the 
Arlington County Employees' Pay Plan, beginning with the adjustment made effective July 1, 2004.*  

 
The lump sum benefit payable under this section shall be reduced by any amount awarded for an accidental 

death occurring in the line of duty by the V.R.S., whether by an insurance policy or otherwise.  

 
Notwithstanding  any  of  the  foregoing,  where  the  County  Manager  finds  that  an  employee's  death,  as  the 
direct and proximate result of a personal injury, was intentionally caused by a third party because the third party was 
motivated  to  cause  the  employee's  death  because  the  employee  performed  a  particular  duty  within  the  employee's 
scope of employment, such death shall be considered to have occurred in the line of duty whether or not it occurred 
on the job.

of  creditable  service  and  average  final  compensation  taken  as  of  the  date  of  his  death.  For  any  member  who  dies 
while  in  service  between  April  19,  2008  and  January  3,  2009,  their  beneficiary’s  allowance  will  be  calculated  as

compensation. The allowance shall be payable monthly to the dependent parents or unremarried spouse for life or to 
the children  until they reach age eighteen (18). A designated beneficiary  who is entitled to a retirement allowance 
under  provisions  of  this  section  as  a  result  of  the  death  of  a  member  shall  be  entitled  to  waive  his  rights  to  such 
allowance by written notification to the  board within ninety (90) days after the death of such member and elect to 
receive  the  amounts  provided  in  §  46-44.D.  All  beneficiaries  must  agree  to  such  waiver  in  the  event  that  there  is 
more  than  one  (1)  designated  beneficiary.  Should  a  designated  beneficiary  die,  the  amount  of  the  member's 
accumulated  contributions  reduced  by  the  amount  of  any  retirement  allowance  received  by  the  designated 
beneficiary  pursuant  to  this  section,  shall  be  payable  in  a  lump  sum  to  a  person  nominated  by  the  designated 
beneficiary or, in the absence thereof, to the estate of the designated beneficiary.

Definitions.  The following words and terms, when used in this section, shall have the following 
meanings unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:  

“Eligible rollover distribution”  means any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the 
credit  of  the  distributee,  except  that  an  eligible  rollover  distribution  does  not  include:  any 
distribution that is one (1) of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently 
than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life 
expectancies)  of  the  distributee  and  the  distributee's  designated  beneficiary,  or  for  a  specified 
period of ten (10) years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under 
Internal  Revenue  Code  §  401(a)(9);  and  the  portion  of  any  distribution  that  is  not  includible  in 
gross  income  (determined  without  regard  to  the  exclusion  for  net  unrealized  appreciation  with 
respect  to  employer  securities);  and  any  other  distribution(s)  that  is  reasonably  expected  to  total 
less than two hundred dollars ($200.00) during a year.  
 
“Eligible retirement plan” Any one of the following that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover 
distribution:  an  individual  retirement  account  described  in  Internal  Revenue  Code  §  408(a),  an 
individual  retirement  annuity  described  in  Internal  Revenue  Code  §  408(b),  an  annuity  plan 
described in Internal Revenue Code § 403(a), a qualified plan described in Internal Revenue Code 
§  401(a),  an  annuity  contract  described  in  Internal  Revenue  Code  §  403(b);  an  eligible  deferred 
compensation  plan  described  in  Internal  Revenue  Code  §  457(b)  that  is  maintained  by  a  state, 
political  subdivision  of  a  state,  or  an  agency  or  instrumentality  of  a  state;  or  effective  for 
distributions  made  after  December  31,  2007,  a  Roth  IRA  described  in  Internal  Revenue  Code  § 
408A, provided the eligible rollover distribution is considered a “qualified rollover contribution” 
under Internal Revenue Code § 408A(e). However, in the case of an eligible rollover distribution 
to  the  surviving  spouse,  an  eligible  retirement  plan  is  an  individual  retirement  account  or 
individual retirement annuity.  
 
“Distributee”  includes  an  employee  or  former  employee.  In  addition,  the  employee's  or  former 
employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse who is the alternate 
payee  under  a  qualified  domestic  relations  order,  as  defined  in  Internal  Revenue  Code  §  414(p), 
are  distributees  with  regard  to  the  interest  of  the  spouse  or  former  spouse.  Effective  for 
distributions  on  or  after  January  1,  2010,  a  distributee  includes  a  non-spouse  beneficiary  of  a 
deceased employee or former employee who may make an eligible rollover distribution in a direct 
trustee-to-trustee transfer to an "inherited" individual retirement account.   
 
“Direct rollover” means a direct rollover or payment by this chapter to the eligible retirement plan 
specified by the distributee.  
 
Notwithstanding any provision of this Chapter to the contrary, distributions to members and their 

J. 

beneficiaries shall be made in compliance with Internal Revenue Code § 401(a)(9) and regulations issued 
thereunder, including the incidental death benefit requirement of Internal Revenue Code § 401(a)(9)(G). 
 

K. 

Notwithstanding anything in this Chapter to the contrary, the amount paid from the Retirement 

Allowance Account of a member for any limitation year for purposes of Internal Revenue Code § 415 shall not 
exceed the maximum permissible amount determined pursuant to the provisions of Internal Revenue Code § 415(b) 
applicable to governmental plans, as defined for purposes of such section.  If the member's benefit for any limitation 
year would exceed such maximum permissible amounts, the benefit shall be reduced for such limitation year so that 
it will equal such maximum permissible amount. 

 
L. 

Should a member reach his normal retirement date as defined in § 46-1 while an employee, the 

rights of the member to accrued benefits under this Chapter shall become nonforfeitable. 

 
M. 

To the extent required by Section 401(a)(37) of the Internal Revenue Code for purposes of 
determining a member’s entitlement to a death benefit under the Plan, in the event a member ceases to be an 
Employee in order to perform qualified military service within the meaning of section 414(u) of the Internal 
Revenue Code and dies on or after January 1, 2007 while performing qualified military service, the member’s death

shall be considered to have occurred while the member was an Employee so that his Beneficiaries are entitled to any 
additional benefits provided under the Plan (other than benefit accruals relating to the period of qualified military 
service), including without limitation any additional or enhanced vesting or death benefits, had the member resumed 
employment with the Employer and then terminated employment on account of death.

§ 46-45. Medical Examination of Beneficiary of Disability Retirement Allowance.  
 
The County Manager shall require a permanent disability retiree, prior to his normal retirement date for an ordinary 
disability retiree and for a service-connected disability retiree, to undergo a medical examination by the medical 
advisor, or the County Manager’s medical appointee in the case of any such retiree residing outside the area serviced 
by the medical advisor--once each year during the first three (3) years following retirement and once in every three 
(3) years thereafter for so long as the retiree continues to receive a disability retirement allowance, provided that 
when it appears in a particular case that the nature of the disability warrants the conclusion that it will continue 
substantially beyond the time of the next regular examination, the County Manager may waive the requirements that 
the retiree undergo the next regular examination. The County Manager shall have the authority to order, for stated 
reasons, a disability retiree to undergo a physical examination at any time. Upon attainment of Normal Retirement 
Age, medical examination will cease for an ordinary disability retiree and for a service-connected disability retiree.

§ 46-46. Reduction of Disability Allowance. 
 

A.  

Whenever  the  County  Manager  ascertains  that  any  retiree  who  has  retired  on  ordinary  disability 
pursuant  to  §  46-39  is,  prior  to  his  normal  retirement  date,  engaged  in  a  gainful  occupation  or  work  paying  more 
than the difference between his disability allowance and his average final compensation, the County Manager shall 
reduce  such  allowance  to  an  amount  which,  together  with  the  amount  earned  by  him,  equals  the  amount  of  his 
average final compensation.  

 
B.  

Should  the  medical  advisor  report  and  certify  to  the  County  Manager  that  any  retiree  who  is 
retired on ordinary disability pursuant to § 46-39 is able to engage in a gainful occupation or work paying more than 
the  difference  between  his  retirement  allowance  and  his  average  final  compensation  at  retirement,  and  should  the 
County  Manager  find  that  such  retiree  shall  have  refused  any  employment  considered  by  the  County  Manager 
suitable to his capacity, he shall not be entitled to any such allowance during the continuance of such refusal, unless 
in the opinion of the County Manager such refusal was justified.  

 
C.  

On or before May 1 of any  year which follows a  year in  which ordinary disability benefits  were 
paid,  every  ordinary  disability  retiree  prior  to  the  retiree’s  normal  retirement  date,  shall  report,  in  such  detail, 
including any and all income tax returns as may be required by the County Manager, all income from wages or self-
employment or both earned in the preceding year.  

 
D.  

Should  the  medical  advisor  report  and  certify  to  the  County  Manager  that  any  retiree  who  has 
retired  on  service-connected  disability  pursuant  to  §  46-41  is  able  to  perform  the  significant  duties  of  the 
classification held at the time of his disability, the County Manager shall terminate the disability allowance.  

 
E.  

Except for an allowance received by a retiree pursuant to § 46-42.B, the retirement allowance for 

service-connected disability determined under the provisions of § 46-42 shall be reduced by: 
 
 

1. 

Any  compensation  awarded  to  the  retiree  under  the  Virginia  Workers'  Compensation  Act  (for 
purposes  of  this  section,  compensation  awarded  does  not  include  reimbursement  for  medical 
expenses)  whether  such  award  is  paid  to  the  member  in  a  lump  sum  or  otherwise,  except 
compensation  awarded  to  cover  any  period  of  time  for  which  the  member  or  retiree  is  not 
receiving  benefits  under  §  46-42  or  compensation  awarded  for  permanent  partial  or  permanent 
total loss or disfigurement, where payments are made from the schedule of payments provided for 
such under the Act; and

F. 

An amount equal to any benefits paid to the member by the Virginia Retirement System. 

Whenever  the  County  Manager  determines  that  a  retiree's  disability  retirement  allowance  should 
be  reduced,  the  amount  of  reduction  shall  be  prorated  over  a  period  of  twelve  (12)  consecutive  months.  Such 
reduction shall commence with the allowance payment for July of the year following the year in which the earnings 
were made.

Editors Note: The provisions adopted in Ord. No. 93-17, adopted July 27, 1993, are effective retroactive to 

Should a disability retiree fail or refuse to undergo the medical examination required by § 46-45 or 
refuse  to  submit  the  reports  required  by  §  46-46.C  or  fail  to  follow  the  directive  of  the  County  Manager  made 
pursuant  to  §  46-41.B,  the  retiree's  retirement  allowance  shall  be  discontinued  until  withdrawal  of  such  refusal. 
Should an ordinary disability  retiree  willfully  file a report required by  § 46-46.C which  contains false information 
which is substantial, the County Manager shall discontinue the retiree's retirement allowance for one (1) year.

§ 46-47. Effect on Retirement Allowance of Returning to Work. 
 
 
Should  a  beneficiary  retired  pursuant  to  §  46-37.A  or  B  return  to  service  as  an  Employee  of  the 
School Board, he shall become a member of the retirement system of which he was a member when he retired and 
shall thereafter contribute to such retirement system. Any service on the basis of which his retirement allowance was 
computed  shall  thereafter  be  counted  as  creditable  service.  Upon  return  to  service,  such  member's  retirement 
allowance shall cease. 
 

A.  

Should a beneficiary retired pursuant to §46-37 return to service as an Employee of an Employer 

B.  

other than the School Board, he shall have the option to: (1) become a member of the System and their retirement 
allowance will cease or (2) participate in the deferred compensation plan provided for in §46-27 and their retirement 
allowance will continue. 
 
 
For  any  person  who  is  receiving  a  retirement  allowance  as  of  April  18,  2009,  and  then  begins  new 
employment with an employer subsequent to January 3, 2009, only service after the date of new employment shall 
earn the multiplier effective as of January 4, 2009,. 
 
Should a beneficiary of a disability retirement allowance return to service at any time prior to his 
 
normal retirement date, he shall become a member of the retirement system of which he was a member when retired 
and  contributions,  in  accordance  with  §  46-32,  shall  resume.  Any  service  on  the  basis  of  which  his  disability 
retirement allowance was computed shall thereafter be counted as creditable service and, in addition, the period of 
disability retirement shall be counted as creditable service for those on service-connected disability retirement. Upon 
return to service, such member's disability allowance shall cease. 
 
 
by him shall be transferred from the retirement allowance account to the member's contribution account. 
 
 
excess allowances over accumulated contributions shall not be transferred to the contribution account.

survivorship  pension  of  actuarial  value  equivalent  to  that  of  the  annual  retirement  allowance,  including  expected 
post-retirement supplements which may be payable pursuant to § 46-49, to which he could otherwise be entitled, as

determined  by  the  actuary.  If  a  married  member  elects  a  beneficiary  other  than  the  member's  spouse,  then  this 
election must have the consent, in a notarized writing, of the member's spouse at the time of application. Such joint 
life and survivorship benefits shall be on the basis of a lifetime annual retirement allowance to the retired member 
with either a like amount of pension, two-thirds (2/3) or one-half (1/2) thereof being continued to his beneficiary if 
said beneficiary survives him. The annual retirement allowance payable monthly shall be determined on a basis of 
equivalent  actuarial  values  according  to  the  ages,  at  the  member's  actual  retirement  date,  of  the  member  and  his 
beneficiary,  and  shall  be  payable  as  long  as  either  lives.  The  payment  of  any  retirement  allowance  in  an  optional 
form  shall  be  calculated  at  the  member’s  actual  retirement  date  using  the  actuarial  equivalent  of  the  normal 
retirement  allowance  payable  under  the  System  using  RP-2000  Healthy  Annuitant  With  White  Collar  Adjustment 
projected  with  Scale  AA  to  2010  for  mortality  rates  and  7.5%  interest.  The  Retirement  Board  shall  have  the 
authority to change the  mortality rate and/or interest rate and such rates shall be published in the System’s annual 
valuation and are incorporated in the Code by reference.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a non-spouse beneficiary 
will be subject to the appropriate benefit adjustments as outlined by regulation 6T of the Internal Revenue Code or 
any successor applicable regulation.  

 
If so elected, the allowance shall be paid as long as: 
 
A. 

C. 

B. 

  
The retired member lives, with either a like amount of pension, two-thirds (2/3) or one-half (1/2) 
thereof  continued  for  as  long  as  the  beneficiary  lives  after  the  death  of  the  retired  member.  The  election  shall 
become  payable  in  accordance  with  the  above  provisions  if  the  member  dies  subsequent  to  his  normal  retirement 
date even though prior to his actual retirement date. 
 
The beneficiary lives, but upon the death of the beneficiary prior to the death of the member, the 
  
option  will  be  canceled  and  the  amount  of  the  unreduced  pension  will  become  payable.  No  retirement  allowance 
shall be paid to a member unless the member has stated whether or not he elects the joint and survivorship option. 
 
Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, any retired member who elects the joint and 
  
survivorship pension option may, with the consent of the person nominated to receive the option, cancel such option. 
Such option may also be canceled pursuant to court order in a case in which the person nominated is a party. In the 
event of either cancellation, the retirement allowance paid to the member in the period after the effective date of the 
cancellation will be the same as if the member had not elected a joint life and survivorship pension option.

In  addition  to  the  allowances  payable  pursuant  to  this  chapter,  post-retirement  supplements  shall 
be payable in accordance with this section to the recipients of such allowances. Such supplements shall be subject to 
the same conditions of payment as are the basic allowances being supplemented. Such supplements shall be treated 
as retirement allowances for the purposes of §§ 46-44.E and 46-47.B. 
 
 
The  amounts  of  the  post-retirement  supplements  provided  hereby  shall  be  determined  as 
percentages  of  the  allowances  which  are  provided  pursuant  to  this  chapter  and  the  V.R.S.  and  which  are 
supplemented hereby. Said percentages shall be determined by reference to the increase, if any, in the  United States 
Average  Consumer Price Index (C.P.I.) for all items, as published by the Bureau of  Labor Statistics of the United 
States Department of Labor, from its monthly average for the calendar year immediately prior to the year in which

 RETIREMENT SYSTEM--II 

C.       The  County  Manager  is  authorized  to  enter  into  agreements  with  retirees  whose  retirement 
allowance  has  been  reduced  or  discontinued  pursuant  to  this  section  whereby  the  County  Manager  agrees  to 
installment payments if in the opinion of the County Manager the facts and circumstances of the retiree's case justify 
such an agreement. In determining whether the facts and circumstances of a retiree's case justify such an agreement, 
the  County  Manager  shall  consider  the  amount  owed,  the  retiree's  age,  ability  to  earn,  and  assets  and  prior 
experience of the member in meeting the requirements of this chapter.  
 

Whenever the  County Manager agrees to enter into such an agreement, the  County Manager shall collect 

six percent (6%) interest per annum on the unpaid balance owed by the retiree.

increased retirement allowance until his Social Security full retirement age as defined as of January 1, 2001 or at the 
early  Social  Security  reduced  benefit  age  if  the  member  elects  to  receive  Social  Security  at  an  early  age  and  a 
decreased  retirement  thereafter,  so  that  a  member  will  receive  a  uniform  or  nearly  uniform  retirement  allowance

Credited service shall be determined by dividing the total hours credited to an employee by 2080. 

Creditable  compensation  for  a  given  year  shall  be  determined  by  multiplying  the  full 
compensation payable annually to an employee by a fraction, not less than one (1), the numerator 
of which is 2080 and the denominator of which is the number of hours credited during such year.

fails to terminate employment by the end of the three (3) year DROP period, as required by this section, such person 
shall  forfeit  allocations  to  the  DROP  account  and  any  earnings  thereto.  In  the  event  of  such  forfeiture,  the 
constitutional officer or employee shall be treated as if there was never any participation in the DROP.  
 
When exiting the DROP on or after January 4, 2009, whichever is later, the employee shall have a 
 
choice  of  either  their  allowance  as  calculated  under  the  formula  effective  until  January  3,  2009  or  the  formula
