A. 

The  following  chemicals  may  be  used  to  treat  swimming  pool  water:  aluminum  sulfate,  calcium 
chloride, calcium hypochlorite, carbon dioxide, cyanuric acid, lime, muriatic acid, polyaluminum chloride, sodium 
bicarbonate,  sodium  bisulfate,  sodium  carbonate,  sodium  hypochlorite,  sodium  thiosulphate,  approved  algaecides, 
approved  bromine  compounds,  and  approved  chelating,  sequestering,  and  clarifying  agents.    No  other  chemicals 
shall  be  used  to  treat  swimming  pool  water  without  prior  written  authorization  from  the  County  Manager  or  his 
designee.   

 
B. 

Aluminum  sulfate  and  polyaluminum  chloride  shall  not  be  fed  continuously  into  a  recirculation 
system using rapid sand filters.  Formation of the flock shall be achieved separately and applied directly to the filter 
influent during the rewash and continuing into the early part of the filter cycle.

Chemical water quality standards for swimming pools shall be as follows: 

Except  as  noted  below,  disinfectant  residual,  pH,  total  alkalinity,  calcium  hardness,  and  total 
dissolved  solids  shall  be  continuously  maintained  within  the  minimum  and  maximum  ranges 
specified  in  Table  III.    If  the  swimming  pool  is  equipped  with  automatic  chemical  controllers 
utilizing  ORP  measurements,  ORP  shall  be  maintained  within  the  ranges  specified  in  Table  III. 
Disinfectant  residual  limits  specified  in  Table  III  may  be  exceeded  in  pools  with  automatic 
chemical controllers, which utilize ORP measurements and continually analyze and automatically 
control pH and the disinfectant residual, only if necessary to maintain the ORP specified in Table 
III.    However,  the  disinfectant  residual  shall  not  exceed  10  ppm  in  such  pools.  The  use  of  ORP 
sensing equipment does not eliminate the requirement for routine water testing specified in § 24.1-
56.  Disinfectant residual limits specified in Table III may be exceeded when superchlorinating a 
swimming  pool  provided  that  no  patrons  are  present  in  the  swimming  pool  water  and  that  the 
disinfectant  level  is  returned  to  the  acceptable  range  prior  to  allowing  patrons  to  enter  the 
swimming pool water.

If  the  spa  pool  is  equipped  with  automatic  chemical  controllers  utilizing  ORP  measurements,  ORP  shall  be 
maintained  within  the  ranges  specified  in  Table  IV.  Disinfectant  residual  limits  specified  in  Table  IV  may  be 
exceeded  in  pools  with  automatic  chemical  controllers,  which  utilize  ORP  measurements  and  continually  analyze 
and automatically control pH and the disinfectant residual, only if necessary to maintain the ORP specified in Table 
IV.  However, the disinfectant residual shall not exceed 10 ppm in such pools. The use of ORP sensing equipment 
does  not  eliminate  the  requirement  for  routine  water  testing  specified  in  §  24.1-90.    Disinfectant  residual  limits 
specified in Table IV may be exceeded when superchlorinating a spa pool provided that no patrons are present in the 
spa pool water and that the disinfectant level is returned to the acceptable range prior to allowing patrons to enter the 
spa pool water.
