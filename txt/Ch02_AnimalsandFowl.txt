§ 2-5. Running at Large Prohibited; Removal of Droppings. 
 
 
It shall be unlawful for the owner of any dog to permit such dog, whether licensed or unlicensed to

The owner of a dog shall be responsible for the removal of the dog's excretion from any property 

All dogs shall be kept secured by a leash or lead, and under the control of the owner or other responsible 
person, or within the real property limits of its owners. A waiver to this requirement for a specific time and place 
may be obtained from the animal Control Officer’s office for such activities as off-lead training, obedience matches 
and  trials,  when  the  dog  has  a  skin  condition  which  would  be  exacerbated  by  the  wearing  of  a  collar,  and  other 
activities which promote animal control. Nothing in this section of the County Code nor in any other section shall be 
deemed to make unlawful the exercising of dogs not upon a leash in areas of the County specifically designated for 
such exercising.

§ 2-6.1. Tethering of Dogs.  
 

Except when a dog’s owner, guardian or custodian is physically within reach of  the dog, it shall be 
unlawful for any person to tether a dog to a chain, rope or line of any  kind that is too short to enable the dog easily to 
stand, sit, lie down, turn about, and   make all other normal body movements in a comfortable, normal position for the  
animal, and reach shade as necessary, for more than three (3) hours cumulatively within  any twenty-four (24) hour 
period, regardless of whether the tethered dog has been  provided adequate space during parts of such period.  For the 
purposes of this section,  “adequate space” shall have the  meaning given to it in Title 3.2 of the Code of Virginia. 
When the same dog is observed to be tethered in the same location that it was in after an  initial observation of the dog 
in  that  location,  then  there  shall  be  a  rebuttable  presumption that  the  dog  has  been  continuously  tethered  in  that 
location since the initial observation. 

A. 

Notwithstanding any other part of this section,  a dog may be attached to a running  cable line or 
trolley system that allows it to reach shelter and water as necessary, except  that no dog may be confined to such a 
running cable line or trolley system for more than  twelve (12) hours cumulatively within any twenty-four (24) hour 
period.  When the same dog is observed to be tethered in the same location on a least two (2) subsequent  occasions in 
the twenty-four (24) hour period that follows an initial observation of the  dog in that location, then there shall be a 
rebuttable presumption that the dog has been  tethered in that location for more than twelve (12) hours cumulatively in 
the twenty-four  (24) hour period since the initial observation.  A running cable line or trolley system is  defined as

one that is at least 20 feet in length and is mounted at least four (4) feet, but no more than seven (7) feet, above the 
ground.  Under no circumstances shall a dog be  attached to a running cable line or trolley system unless the tether 
attaching it to the  running cable line or trolley system is at least ten (10) feet in length or three (3) times the length of 
the animal, as measured from the tip of its nose to the base of its tail, whichever is longer.

§ 2-7. Dogs Over F Months Old to be Licensed.  
 

It shall be unlawful for the owner or custodian of any dog over four (4) months old not to place or cause to

§ 2-8. Rabies Vaccination. 
 
 
It shall be unlawful for any person to keep, harbor or have in his custody or control a dog of six 
(6) months old or older, for longer than fourteen (14) days, unless such dog has been vaccinated with a modified live 
virus (Avianied) rabies vaccine approved by the Virginia State Department of Health within a period of thirty-six 
(36)  months  or  vaccinated  within  a  period  of  twelve  (12)  months  with  a  killed  rabies  vaccine  approved  by  the 
Virginia State Department of Health.  
 

No  license  shall  be  issued  for  any  dog  by  Arlington  County  unless  there  is  presented  at  the  time  of 
application for such license, a certificate of rabies vaccination or inoculation signed by a licensed veterinarian and 
certifying that the dog for which the license is to be issued has been vaccinated or inoculated by the said veterinarian 
as required above. The license period shall not exceed the effective period of the vaccine but licenses issued after 
July 1, 2019 will be valid again upon renewal of the dog’s rabies vaccination. The certificate shall show the date of 
expiration, the type of vaccine used (whether modified live virus or killed virus), the rabies tag number, the sex and 
breed of the dog and the name of the owner. No certificate or affidavit other than the above-described certificate or a 
duplicate issued by a licensed veterinarian shall be accepted. 

Whenever  it  becomes  necessary  to  provide  the  public  with  additional  safeguards  against  the 
 
danger of rabies, the County Board shall issue a proclamation ordering every person owning or keeping a dog to 
confine  it  securely  on  his  premises.  Any  dog  not  on  the  premises  of  its  owner  shall  have  a  muzzle  of  sufficient 
strength  to  prevent  its  biting  any  person.  It  shall  be  unlawful  not  to  comply  with  the  requirements  of  such 
proclamation. All dogs apprehended by any officer that are noticeably infected with rabies and displaying vicious 
propensities shall be killed by the officer without notice to the owner. 
 
 
Dogs  showing  active  signs  of  rabies  or  suspected  of  having  rabies  shall  be  confined  under 
competent observation for such time as may be necessary to determine a diagnosis. If confinement is impossible or 
impracticable, such dog shall be destroyed. 
 
 
Every person having knowledge of the existence of an animal apparently afflicted with rabies shall 
report immediately to the local health department the existence of such animal, the place where seen, the owner's 
name, if known, and the symptoms suggesting rabies. 
 
 

Any dog bitten by an animal believed to be afflicted with rabies shall be destroyed immediately or

§ 2-9. Impoundment; Redemption; Disposition of Infected Animals. 
 
 
It shall be the duty of any Officer to apprehend any dog found running at large and to impound 
such dog in such retention facilities as are provided by the County. A complete registry shall be maintained of the 
breed, color and sex of all dogs so apprehended. If the ownership of a dog so impounded can be determined, the 
owner shall be notified, and the dog returned to such owner upon the payment of a reasonable and fair fee to be 
determined by the Animal Control Agency to cover the cost of boarding an animal. If the owner cannot provide 
proof of current license for the dog then the Animal Control Agency shall not release the dog until fees for rabies 
vaccination and license have been paid. 
 
For subsequent impoundment  within one (1)  year there shall be an additional fee of ten dollars 
 
($10.00) for the second impoundment, and an additional fee of twenty dollars ($20.00) for the third impoundment

be sold or destroyed. 
 
 
Impounded dogs not having a current license tag at the neck shall be confined for a period of five 
(5) days unless sooner redeemed by the owner. If at the expiration of five (5) days, such dog shall not have been 
redeemed, it may be sold or destroyed. 
 
 
The Animal Control Agency shelter may euthanize before the five (5) day holding period is up any 
stray, nonlicensed animal which is injured or diseased, if in their opinion the animal is injured beyond help or if the 
disease appears to be contagious and no owner can be immediately located.

meanings unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:  
 

Definitions. The following  words and terms,  when  used in this article, shall  have the  following 

“Dangerous dog” means a canine or canine crossbreed which has bitten, attacked, or inflicted injury on a 

A.  

person or companion animal, or killed a companion animal.  

 
“Vicious dog” shall mean a canine or canine crossbreed which: 
 
1. 

Killed a person; or 

  
 
  

 
  

2. 

3. 

Inflicted  serious  injury  to  a  person,  including  multiple  bites,  serious  disfigurement,  serious 
impairment of health, or serious impairment of a bodily function; or 

Continued  to  exhibit  the  behavior  which  resulted  in  a  previous  finding  by  a  court  that  it  is  a 
dangerous dog, provided that its owner or custodian has been given notice of that finding. 

B.  

 
 
Impoundment; euthanization. Any Animal Control Officer that has reason to believe that a canine 
or canine crossbreed within the County is a dangerous or vicious dog shall apply to a magistrate for the issuance of a 
summons requiring the owner or custodian, if known, to appear before a general district court at a specified time. 
The  summons  shall  advise  the  owner  or  custodian  of  the  nature  of  the  proceeding  and  the  matters  at  issue.  The 
Animal Control Officer or owner shall confine the animal until such time as evidence shall be heard and a verdict 
rendered, if the animal poses a substantial risk to humans or other animals. If the animal does not pose such a risk or 
if the owner or custodian can adequately confine the animal without risk of its escape, the Animal Control Officer or 
police officer shall order the owner or custodian to keep the animal confined inside a dwelling or adequate structure 
so constructed to prevent its escape. Until such time as evidence may be heard and a verdict rendered, the animal 
may not be removed from the owner's or custodian's immediate property and must be secured on a leash no longer 
than six (6) feet when not confined indoors or locked within an adequate structure. Failure to comply with such an 
order shall be a violation of this section. The court, through its contempt powers, may compel the owner, custodian 
or harborer of the animal to produce the animal. If, after hearing evidence, the court finds the animal is a dangerous 
dog, the court shall order the animal's owner or custodian to comply with the provisions of Subsection D. If, after 
hearing the evidence, the court finds the animal is a vicious dog, the court shall order the animal euthanized by the 
Animal Control Officer, in accordance with state law. 
 
 
Exceptions.  No  animal  shall  be  found  to  be  a  dangerous  or  vicious  dog  solely  because  it  is  a 
particular  breed.  No  animal  shall  be  found  to  be  a  dangerous  or  vicious  dog  if  the  threat,  injury  or  damage  was 
sustained by a person who was: 
 
  
 
  

Committing, at the time, a crime upon the premises occupied by the animal's owner or custodian; 

Committing, at the time, a willful trespass or other tort upon the premises occupied by the animal's 
owner or custodian; or

No police dog which was engaged in the performance of its duties at the time of the acts complained of 
shall  be  found  to  be  a  dangerous  or  vicious  dog.  No  animal  which,  at  the  time  of  the  acts  complained  of,  was

1. 

The owner or custodian of any animal found by a court to be a dangerous dog shall, within ten 
(10) days of such finding, obtain a dangerous dog registration certificate from the Animal Control 
Officer for a fee of fifty dollars ($50.00), in addition to other fees that may be authorized by law. 
The  Animal  Control  Officer  shall  also  provide  the  owner  with  a  uniformly  designed  tag  which 
identifies the animal as a dangerous dog. The owner or custodian shall affix the tag to the animal's 
collar  and  ensure  that  the  animal  wears  the  collar  and  tag  at  all  times.  All  certificates  obtained 
pursuant to this paragraph shall be renewed annually for the same fee and in the same manner as 
the initial certificate was obtained. If the owner fails to obtain such a certificate within the time 
allotted, the Animal Control Officer shall have the power to seize the animal and euthanize the 
animal in accordance with State law. 

2. 

a.  Certificates  shall  only  be  issued  to  persons  eighteen  (18)  years  of  age  or  older  who  present 
satisfactory evidence that: 

(1) 

(2) 

The animal has a current rabies vaccination, if applicable; 

The animal is and will be confined in a proper enclosure designed to prevent its escape or 
is  and  will  be  confined  inside  the  owner's  or  custodian's  residence  or  is  and  will  be

until the proper enclosure can be constructed.  

b.  In  addition,  owners  or  custodians  who  apply  for  certificates  or  renewals  thereof  under  this 
section shall not be issued a certificate or renewal thereof unless they present satisfactory evidence 
that: 
 
(1) 

Their residence is and will continue to be posted with clearly visible signs warning both 
minors and adults of the presence of a dangerous dog on the property; and 

(2) 

The animal has been permanently identified by means of a tattoo on the inside thigh or by 
electronic implant. 

While  on  the  property  of  its  owner  or  custodian,  an  animal  to  be  found  by  the  court  to  be  a 
dangerous  dog  shall  be  confined  indoors  or  in  a  securely  enclosed  and  locked  structure  of 
sufficient  height  and  design,  with  adequate  shelter,  to  prevent  its  escape  and  to  prevent  direct 
contact with or entry by minors, adults or animals. When off its owner's or custodian's property, an 
animal found by a court to be a dangerous dog shall be caged or kept securely on leash no longer 
than six (6) feet and muzzled in such a manner as not to cause injury to the animal or interfere 
with  the  animal's  vision  or  respiration,  but  so  as  to  prevent  it  from  biting  a  person  or  another 
animal. 

If the owner or custodian of a dangerous dog is an unemancipated minor, the custodial parent or 
legal guardian shall be responsible for complying with all the requirements of this section. 

After an animal has been found by a court to be a dangerous dog, the animal's owner or custodian
