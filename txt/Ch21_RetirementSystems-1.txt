The right of any member to a retirement allowance, to the return of accumulated contributions, or any other 
right  or  moneys  accrued  or  accruing  to  any  person  under  the  provisions  of  this  chapter  shall  not  be  subject  to

the  County  Manager  may  authorize  the  payment  of  interest  on  the  unpaid  balance  owed  to  the  member  or 
beneficiary at a rate to be determined by the County Manager provided that the error in payment was discovered 
after January 1, 2001.

The County Board shall have the continuing right and power to amend or supplement this chapter at any 
time. No amendment shall be made unless the actuary has filed with the County Board a report as to its effect upon 
the  System,  and  no  amendment  shall  be  adopted  which  will  reduce  the  then-accrued  benefits  of  employees  or 
beneficiaries below the extent they are then covered by accumulated reserves, which reserves shall constitute a trust 
fund for the payment of such benefits. 

§ 21-9.1. Continuation of Benefits for Circuit Court Judges, General District Court Judges and Juvenile and 
Domestic Relations District Court Judges.  
 

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter or any other provision of law to the contrary, circuit 
court judges shall continue to be members of the retirement system provided for by this chapter on the same basis on 
which  they  participated  on  March  1,  1976;  and  general  district  court  judges  and  juvenile  and  domestic  relations 
district court judges who were in office on July 1, 1973, on the same basis on which they then participated, if they 
elect in writing to be so considered. The County shall continue to pay an employer's contribution on behalf of such 
judges  based  upon  the  annual  local  supplement  paid  to  each  circuit  court  judge  as  of  March  1,  1976,  and  each 
district court judge as of July 1, 1973; and each judge shall make contributions or have his contributions picked up 
by the employer at periodic intervals of not less than once a calendar month which shall represent the employee's 
contribution,  including  pick  up  contributions.  The  amounts  of  the  employer's  contribution  and  employee's 
contribution, including pickup contributions, shall be on the same proportionate basis which applied to all members 
except police officers, firefighters and deputy sheriffs at the time of payment by the employer and employee. For all 
purposes of this chapter, such circuit court judges, general district court judges and juvenile and domestic relations 
district  court  judges  shall  be  considered  members,  and  all  provisions  hereof  shall  apply  to  them  as  apply  to  all 
members other than police officers, firefighters and deputy sheriffs.

permanently  disabled  for  duty,  upon  written  application  to  the  County  Manager  made  by  the  member  or  his 
appointing authority, setting forth the date the retirement is to become effective. Such effective date shall be after 
the last day of service.  
 

No allowance for retirement may be awarded until after the medical advisor has examined the applicant and 

has certified that: 

 
1. 

  
 
  

 
  

 

 

The member has suffered a permanent disability resulting from an injury or occupational disease; 

2. 

3. 

The  disability  has  rendered  the  member  mentally  or  physically  incapacitated  for  the  further 
performance  of  the  significant  duties  of  the  classification  which  he  held  at  the  time  of  his 
disability; and 

Such disability is the natural and proximate result of an accident or injury which occurred at some 
definite time or place, or such disability was the natural and proximate result of an occupational 
disease that was contracted as a result of exposure occasioned by employment.  

The medical advisor shall consider all medical information provided by the Worker's Compensation office 
of the County and the Worker's Compensation treating physician and will consult the treating physician as necessary 
before rendering an opinion.  

 
No ordinary disease of life to which the general public is exposed outside of employment shall be the basis 
for  retirement  unless  such  disease  is  found  to  be  compensable  under  Workers'  Compensation  and  the  County 
Manager finds beyond a reasonable doubt that the ordinary disease of life (1) did not result from any cause outside 
of employment and (2) either:  

 

 

a. 

Followed as an incident of an occupational disease; or  

b.      

Resulted solely, naturally, and unavoidably from an injury which occurred while in the 
actual performance of the member's occupational duties at some definite time and place.  

No allowance shall be awarded unless the County Manager finds that the accident or injury upon which the 
medical advisor based its medical certification occurred, in fact, while the applicant was in the actual performance of 
duty at some definite time or place or the County Manager finds that the exposure upon which the medical advisor 
based its medical certification was occasioned, in fact, by employment.  
 

If the medical advisor's opinion disagrees with the Worker's Compensation treating physician, the County 

Manager may appoint a second medical advisor for an independent opinion on the case if desired.  
 

The  phrase  "permanent  disability"  shall  not  be  construed  to  include  a  medical  condition  which  may  be 

corrected if the member follows a reasonable medical treatment plan or reasonable medical advice.  
 

B.       Temporary  disability.  If,  after  conducting  the  examination,  the  medical  advisor  certifies  that  the 
requirements for permanent disability are met, except that it has not been determined if the disability is permanent, 
or  if  in  the  opinion  of  the  physician  the  disability  may  be  alleviated  or  eliminated  if  the  applicant  follows  a 
reasonable medical treatment plan or reasonable medical advice, the physician shall notify the County Manager in 
writing of his findings, stating his reasons and recommendations. The County Manager shall direct the member to 
follow such a plan or advice unless it determines that the risk to the member of the plan or advice is too high or the 
probability of success too low, given all the facts and circumstances, and the member shall be temporarily retired.  
 

The case of each member retired pursuant to this subsection B shall be reviewed by the County Manager at 
such time as is determined by the County Manager; and if no specific time for review is determined, the member's 
case shall be reviewed by the County within twelve (12) months from the date the temporary retirement was granted.  
Any person whose disability application is denied, or whose temporary disability benefit is terminated, may appeal 
to the board pursuant to § 21-57.

The retirement allowance determined under the provisions of this § 21-46 shall be reduced by any

shall be made only for compensation awarded to cover any period of time for which the member or retiree is or will 
be  receiving  benefits  under  §  21-45.  No  such  reduction  shall  be  made  for  compensation  awarded  for  permanent 
partial or permanent total loss or disfigurement, where payments are made from the schedule of payments provided 
for such under the Act. When the time for which payments of compensation under the Act has elapsed, such retiree 
shall  thereafter  receive  the  full  amount  of  such  allowance  payable  monthly  during  his  lifetime  and  continued 
disability.  For  purposes  of  this  section,  compensation  awarded  does  not  include  reimbursement  for  medical

going to or from work (including between any parking lot or transportation terminal and the employee's work place), 
going to or from meals or breaks, or time spent while "on call" or on stand-by status unless the employee is involved 
in a specific work-related duty during such period.  

 
“Personal injury” means any traumatic injury as well as diseases which are caused by or result from such 
an  injury,  excluding  occupational  diseases  and  diseases  of  ordinary  life.  The  term  personal  injury  excludes  any 
personal injury caused or contributed to by the intentional misconduct or negligence of the member or beneficiary as 
well  as  suicide.  The  term  personal  injury  also  excludes  any  injury  caused  or  contributed  to  by  the  member's 
consumption of alcohol or illegal drugs.  

 
“Traumatic  injury”  means  a  wound  or  other  condition  of  the  body  caused  by  external  force,  including 
injuries  inflicted  by  bullets,  explosives,  smoke  inhalation,  sharp  or  blunt  instruments  or  objects,  physical  blows, 
chemicals,  electricity,  climatic  conditions,  infectious  diseases,  radiation,  and  bacteria,  but  excluding  stress  and 
strain.  Death  from  heart  attacks,  strokes  and  similar  diseases  resulting  from  chronic,  congenital  or  progressive 
cardiac and/or pulmonary conditions are not compensable unless a traumatic injury was a substantial factor in the 
death. Heart attacks and stroke shall be presumed to be caused by a traumatic injury where such heart attacks and 
stroke were substantially caused by arduous and strenuous physical work-related activity. 

 
The beneficiary of any member who dies in the line of duty shall receive a payment of two (2) 
times  the  member's  base  salary  at  the  time  of  death,  up  to  a  maximum  of  one  hundred  fifty  thousand  dollars 
($150,000.00). Such payment may be received by the beneficiary only after the payment is approved by the County 
Manager as set forth below. Following approval by the County Manager, the beneficiary may elect to receive the 
payment either in one (1) lump sum or in four (4) equal installments; the first installment to be made after approval 
of the application for payment by the County Manager and the remaining three (3) installments annually thereafter. 
In the event that there is more than one (1) beneficiary no election by beneficiaries is allowed and payment shall be 
of the full payment only, divided between or among the beneficiaries in the same manner which the member has 
designated for the life insurance policy provided by or made available by the employer.  
 

In addition, the member's beneficiary shall receive a benefit equal to the service retirement benefit payable 
under § 21-42 to the member as if the member had worked thirty (30) years and then retired from the County. This 
benefit is payable to the member's beneficiary until the member would have reached normal retirement age. Upon 
reaching normal retirement age, the benefit will be equal to the benefit that would be paid to the survivor had the 
participant worked until normal retirement age, retired and elected a one hundred percent (100%) joint and survivor 
benefit and died immediately.  

 
Additionally, any surviving children, or their legal guardian, shall receive undergraduate tuition assistance 
equal to in-state tuition, room and board at the University of Virginia until the child reaches age twenty-three (23), 
plus thirty-three percent (33%). This benefit is payable in an exact amount as determined by the County Manager on 
a semester by semester basis by submitting the appropriate documentation as determined by the County Manager.  
 

The beneficiary(ies) may apply for payment within one hundred eighty (180) days of the member's death 
by  making  application  to  the  County  Manager.  The  County  Manager  may  adopt  procedures  for  making  and 
evaluating applications for this benefit. The County Manager shall approve payment under this section only after 
finding that the member has died as the direct and proximate result of a personal injury sustained in the line of duty.  
 

Before  approving  any  application,  the  County  Manager  must  receive  a  written  certification  from  the 
medical advisor that the member has died as the direct and proximate result of a personal injury identified by the 
medical advisor and the County’s legal advisor certifies that all the requirements of this section have been met.  

 
The  one  hundred  fifty  thousand  dollar  ($150,000.00)  maximum  established  under  this  section  shall  be 
increased by the same amount as the annual cost of living adjustment made by the Arlington County Board for the 
Arlington County Employees' Pay Plan, beginning with the adjustment made effective July 1, 2004.  

 
The lump sum benefit payable under this section shall be reduced by any amount awarded for an accidental 

death occurring in the line of duty by the V.R.S., whether by an insurance policy or otherwise.

Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, where the County Manager finds that an employee's death, as the

years of service and has not made the election provided in subsection B, he shall be paid, on demand or as soon as

If a member has ceased to be an employee, other than by death or by retirement, after completion 
of five (5) or more years of service and has not elected in writing as prescribed by the County Manager to withdraw 
the total amount of his contribution account, he will be eligible to receive a deferred vested retirement allowance 
commencing on his normal retirement date. The allowance will be the amount determined as provided in § 21-42 
based  upon  the  member's  years  of  creditable  service  and  average  final  compensation  taken  as  of  the  date  of  his

prior  to  the  former  member's  normal  retirement  date  and  it  must  be  filed  not  later  than  his 
seventieth (70th) birthday, or the retirement allowance shall not be payable at any time.  

If a former member is re-employed by the employer and becomes a member of the supplemental retirement

equal  to  at  least  five  hundred  dollars  ($500.00)  paid  directly  to  an  eligible  retirement  plan 
specified by the distributee in a direct rollover.

Definitions. The following words and terms, when used in this section, shall have the following 
meanings unless the context clearly indicates otherwise: 

“Eligible rollover distribution” means any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the 
credit  of  the  distributee,  except  that  an  eligible  rollover  distribution  does  not  include:  any 
distribution  that  is  one  of  a  series  of  substantially  equal  periodic  payments  (not  less  frequently 
than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life 
expectancies)  of  the  distributee  and  the  distributee's  designated  beneficiary,  or  for  a  specified 
period of ten (10) years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under 
Internal  Revenue  Code  §  401(a)(9);  and  the  portion  of  any  distribution  that  is  not  includible  in 
gross  income  (determined  without  regard  to  the  exclusion  for  net  unrealized  appreciation  with 
respect to employer securities); and any other distribution(s) that is reasonably expected to total 
less than two hundred dollars ($200.00) during a year.  
 
“Eligible retirement plan”  means any one of the  following that accepts the distributee's eligible 
rollover  distribution:  an  individual  retirement  account  described  in  Internal  Revenue  Code  § 
408(a), an individual retirement annuity described in Internal Revenue Code § 408(b), an annuity 
plan described in Internal Revenue Code § 403(a), a qualified plan described in Internal Revenue 
Code § 401(a), an annuity contract described in Internal Revenue §  403(b); an eligible deferred 
compensation  plan  described  in  Internal  Revenue  Code  §  457(b)  that  is  maintained  by  a  state, 
political  subdivision  of  a  state,  or  an  agency  or  instrumentality  of  a  state;  or  effective  for 
distributions made after December 31, 2007, a Roth IRA described in Internal Revenue Code § 
408A, provided the eligible rollover distribution is considered a “qualified rollover contribution” 
under Internal Revenue Code § 408A(e). However, in the case of an eligible rollover distribution 
to  the  surviving  spouse,  an  eligible  retirement  plan  is  an  individual  retirement  account  or 
individual retirement annuity.  
 
“Distributee”  includes  an  employee  or  former  employee.  In  addition,  the  employee's  or  former 
employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse who is the alternate 
payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in Internal Revenue Code § 414(p), 
are  distributees  with  regard  to  the  interest  of  the  spouse  or  former  spouse.  Effective  for 
distributions  on  or  after  January  1,  2010,  a  distributee  includes  a  non-spouse  beneficiary  of  a 
deceased employee or former employee who may make an eligible rollover distribution in a direct 
trustee-to-trustee transfer to an "inherited" individual retirement account.   
 
“Direct rollover” means a direct rollover or payment by this chapter to the eligible retirement plan 
specified by the distributee.  
 
 
Notwithstanding any provision of this Chapter to the contrary, distributions to members and their 
beneficiaries shall be made in compliance with Internal Revenue Code § 401(a)(9) and regulations 
issued thereunder, including the incidental death benefit requirement of Internal Revenue Code § 
401(a)(9)(G). 

Notwithstanding  anything  in  this  Chapter  to  the  contrary,  the  amount  paid  from  the  Retirement 
Allowance Account of a member for any limitation year for purposes of Internal Revenue Code § 
415 shall not exceed the maximum permissible amount determined pursuant to the provisions of 
Internal Revenue Code § 415(b) applicable to governmental plans, as defined for purposes of such 
section.  If the member's benefit for any limitation year would exceed such maximum permissible 
amounts, the benefit shall be reduced for such limitation year so that it will equal such maximum 
permissible amount.

serviced by the  medical advisor, once each year during the first three (3) years  following retirement and once in 
every three (3) years thereafter; provided, that when it appears in a particular case that the nature of the disability 
warrants  the  conclusion  that  it  will  continue  substantially  beyond  the  time  of  the  next  regular  examination,  the 
County  Manager  may  waive  the  requirement  that  the  retiree  undergo  the  next  regular  examination.  The  County

Whenever the County Manager ascertains that any retiree who has retired on ordinary disability 
pursuant to § 21-43 is, prior to his normal retirement date, engaged in a gainful occupation or work paying more 
than the difference between his disability allowance and his average final compensation, the County Manager shall 
reduce such retirement allowance to an amount which, together with the amount earned by him, equals the amount 
of his average final compensation.  

A.  

Should  the  medical  advisor  report  and  certify  to  the  County  Manager  that  any  retiree  who  has 
retired on ordinary disability pursuant to § 21-43 is able to engage in a gainful occupation or work paying more than 
the difference between his retirement allowance and his average final compensation at retirement, and should the 
County  Manager  find  that  such  retiree  shall  have  refused  any  employment  considered  by  the  County  Manager 
suitable to his capacity, he shall not be entitled to any such allowance during the continuance of such refusal unless, 
in the opinion of the County Manager, such refusal was justified.  

On or before May 1 of any year which follows a year in which ordinary disability benefits were 
paid and prior to the retiree’s normal retirement date, every ordinary disability retiree shall report, in such detail 
including any and all income tax returns as may be required by the County Manager, all income from wages or self-
employment or both earned in the preceding year.  

Whenever the County Manager determines that an ordinary disability retiree's disability retirement 
allowance should be reduced, the amount of reduction shall be prorated over a period of twelve (12) consecutive 
months.  Such  reduction  shall  commence  with  the  allowance  payment  for  July  of  the  year  following  the  year  in 
which the earnings were made.

§ 21-52. Joint and Survivorship Options.  
 
A member may nominate a beneficiary and may elect, by written application filed with the County Manager any 
time prior to his normal, early, ordinary or service-connected disability retirement, a joint life and survivorship 
pension of actuarial value equivalent to that of the annual retirement allowance, including expected post-retirement 
supplements which may be payable pursuant to § 46-49, to which he could otherwise be entitled, as determined by 
the actuary.  If a married member elects a beneficiary other than the member's spouse, then this election must have 
the consent, in a notarized writing, of the member's spouse at the time of application. Such joint life and 
survivorship benefits shall be on the basis of a lifetime annual retirement allowance to the retired member with 
either a like amount of pension, two-thirds (2/3) or one-half (1/2) thereof being continued to his beneficiary if said 
beneficiary survives him. The annual retirement allowance payable monthly shall be determined on a basis of 
equivalent actuarial values according to the ages, at the member's actual retirement date, of the member and his 
beneficiary, and shall be payable as long as either lives. The payment of any retirement allowance in an optional 
form shall be calculated at the member’s actual retirement date using the actuarial equivalent of the normal 
retirement allowance payable under the System using RP-2000 Healthy Annuitant With White Collar Adjustment 
projected with Scale AA to 2010 for mortality rates and 7.5% interest. The Retirement Board shall have the 
authority to change the mortality rate and/or interest rate and such rates shall be published in the System’s annual

Upon the death of any police officer, firefighter or deputy sheriff who has retired pursuant to § 21-41.A or 
21-42.B.3, and who has not named a beneficiary other than their spouse, one-half (1/2) of that member's retirement 
allowance shall continue to be payable to his or her spouse for the life of the latter, provided that such person was 
the member's lawful spouse at the time of the member's retirement. This specific spousal benefit is provided with no

The beneficiary lives, but upon the death of the beneficiary prior to the death of the member, the 
option  will be canceled and the amount of the unreduced pension  will become payable. No retirement allowance 
shall be paid to a member unless the member has stated whether or not he elects the joint and survivorship option. 
 
  
Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, any retired member who elects the joint and 
survivorship pension option may, with the consent of the person nominated to receive the option, cancel such option. 
Such option may also be canceled pursuant to court order in a case in which the person nominated is a party. In the 
event of either cancellation, the retirement allowance paid to the member in the period after the effective date of the 
cancellation will be the same as if the member had not elected a joint life and survivorship pension option.

In  addition  to  the  allowances  payable  under  §§  21-42,  21-44,  21-46,  21-48.B  and  21-52,  post 
retirement supplements shall be payable in accordance with the provisions of this section to the recipients of such 
allowances, with respect to allowance payments falling due on and after July 1, 1970. Such supplements shall be 
subject to the same conditions of payment as are the basic allowances being supplements hereby. Such supplements 
shall be treated as retirement allowances for the purposes of §§ 21-47.B, 21-48.D, and 21-51.B. 
 
 
The amount of any post-retirement supplement payable under the provisions of this section shall 
be determined as a percentage of the basic allowance being supplemented. The percentage applicable for any month 
with respect to any retired member or with respect to any beneficiary receiving payments under § 21-52 shall be 
computed so that the sum of the basic allowance plus the supplement  shall equal the product resulting  when the 
basic allowance is multiplied by (1.015)n, where n is the number of completed years in the period between the last 
day of employment of the member on whose account the basic allowance is payable and the first day of the month 
for which the computation is being made. 
 
 
The  amount  of  any  post-retirement  supplement  shall  be  adjusted,  after  its  initial  determination, 
only  in  July  each  year  next  following  the  anniversary  of  the  last  day  of  employment  of  the  member,  except  as 
necessary  to  reflect  changes  in  the  amount  of  the  basic  allowance  being  supplemented,  to  the  end  that  any  post-
retirement supplement shall remain a constant percentage of the basic allowance until the next following anniversary
