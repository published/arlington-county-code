deferral  or  both  are  claimed  during  the  year  immediately  preceding  the  taxable  year  shall  be  determined  in  an

owner’s spouse as of December 31 of the year immediately preceding the taxable year shall be determined in an

include the present  value of  all assets including equitable  interests, of  the owner(s) and the owner's  spouse, and 
shall exclude the assessed value of the property for which exemption or deferral, or both are claimed. If the total 
combined net financial worth of the owner(s) and the owner’s spouse as of December 31 of the year immediately 
preceding the taxable year exceeds the applicable limit, the total combined net financial worth shall be reduced by 
total unreimbursed allowable medical and dental care expenses for the year immediately preceding the taxable year, 
total  unreimbursed  allowable  emergency  home  repairs  exceeding  $1,000.00  per  repair  for  the  year  immediately 
preceding  the  taxable  year,  and/or  total  unreimbursed  Condominium  Association  individual  special  assessments 
exceeding  $1,000.00  per  assessment  for  the  year  immediately  preceding  the  taxable  year. Beginning  in  calendar 
year 2020, the asset limit for both exemption and deferral shall be adjusted annually, based upon the twelve-month 
percent change in the  Consumer Price Index for  Americans 62  years of age and older (CPI-E) for All Items, as 
released  by  the  United  States  Department  of  Labor  Bureau  of  Labor  Statistics  for  September  of  the  year 
immediately preceding the taxable year.

If  the  age  or  disability  requirements  are  met  during  the  taxable  year,  or  if  the  title  of  the  property  is 
obtained during the taxable year, the portion of a qualifying person's real estate tax eligible for exemption or deferral 
or both shall be prorated to reflect the number of complete months of the taxable year that the person qualifies for 
exemption  or  deferral  or  both  by  meeting  the  stated  age  or  disability or ownership  requirements  of  the  program, 
provided that timely application is made.  

 
The County Manager may extend the deadline for filing the affidavit to any date between November 16 and 
January 31 of the next calendar year, upon his finding that extreme circumstances beyond the control of the owner 
prevented  the  owner  from  filing  the  affidavit  by  November  15,  provided  such  an  extension  would  promote  the 
purposes of this chapter and not interfere with the efficient administration of provisions of this chapter. 

 
The  County  Manager  may  grant  retroactive  real  estate  tax  relief  to  an  owner  otherwise  meeting  the 
requirements for exemption or deferral or both in the event that extreme circumstances beyond the control of the 
owner prevented the owner from filing a timely affidavit, or if the owner is retroactively determined to be totally and 
permanently  disabled,  subject  to  the  limitation  that  any  exemption  or  deferral  or  both  may  only  be  retroactively 
granted  for  a  maximum  of  two  taxable  years  immediately  preceding  the  taxable  year  in  which  the  affidavit  is 
properly made.

The  affidavit  shall  set  forth  in  a  manner  prescribed  by  the  County  Manager  the  names  of  the 
related persons occupying the dwelling for which exemption or deferral or both are claimed, their gross combined 
income and their total combined net worth. The affidavit shall also indicate whether the person or persons claim the 
exemption or the deferral or the combination exemption and deferral and deferral option, and if deferral the amount 
claimed up to one hundred percent (100%) of the real estate tax liability. 
 
 
If  after  audit  and  investigation  the  County  Manager  determines  that  the  person  or  persons  are 
qualified for exemption or deferral or both, he shall so certify to the Treasurer of Arlington County who shall deduct 
the amount of the exemption or deferral or both from the claimant's real estate liability.

Taxes deferred for tax year 2001 and beyond shall be paid without penalty or interest and shall be 
paid to the Treasurer of Arlington County by the vendor, transferor, executor, or administrator: (i) upon sale of the 
real estate; (ii) upon a nonqualified transfer of the real estate; or (iii) from the estate of the decedent within one (1) 
year after the death of the last qualified owner thereof. Such deferred real estate taxes shall constitute a lien upon the 
said  real  estate  as  if  they  had  been  assessed  without  regard  to  the  deferral  permitted  by  this  chapter,  provided, 
however,  that  such  liens  shall,  to  the  extent  that  they  exceed  in  the  aggregate  ten  percent  (10%)  of  the  price  for 
which such real estate may be sold, be inferior to all other liens of record. Any interest which has accrued on any
