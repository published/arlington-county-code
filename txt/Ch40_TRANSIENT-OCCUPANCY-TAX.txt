§ 40-1. Definitions.  
 

The following words and terms, when used in this chapter, shall have the following meanings unless the 

context clearly indicates otherwise: 

 
“County Manager” means the County Manager of Arlington County, Virginia, or any of his designees. 

 
“Hotel”  means  any  public  or  private  hotel,  inn,  apartment  hotel,  hostelry,  tourist  home  or  house,  motel, 
 
rooming house or other lodging place within Arlington County offering lodging and the owner and operator thereof, 
who for compensation, furnishes lodging to any transients as hereinafter defined. 
 
“Room rental” means the total charge made by any such hotel for lodging and/or space furnished any such 
 
transient. If the charge made by such hotel to such transient includes any charge for services or accommodations in 
addition to that of lodging, and/or the use of space, then such portion of the total charge as represents only room and/or 
space rental shall be distinctly set out and billed to such transient by such hotel as a separate item. 
 
“Transient” means any natural person or individual who for any period of fewer than thirty (30) consecutive 
 
days occupies a lodging room in any hotel for which occupancy a charge is made whether such charge is paid by the 
occupant or by another. Transient shall also mean any natural person or individual who rents a meeting, banquet, or 
other hotel space for purposes other than lodging for any period of fewer than thirty (30) consecutive days. Contracting 
and paying for the occupancy of a lodging room or rooms for thirty (30) consecutive days or more, when the lodging 
room or rooms are occupied by different individuals or by different groups of individuals for fewer than thirty (30) 
consecutive days constitutes transient occupancy or use of the rooms and is subject to the tax provided by this chapter.

Ord. No. 17-06, 4-22-17) 
 
§ 40-2. Levy and Rate.  
 

In addition to all other taxes of every kind now or hereafter imposed by law, there is hereby imposed and 
levied on each and every transient a tax equivalent to five and one-quarter percent (5.25%) of the total amount paid 
for room rental by or for any such transient to any hotel.  

 
The difference between the receipts from a tax of five and one-quarter percent (5.25%) and five percent (5%) 
of the total amount paid for room rentals taxed under the previous paragraph shall be designated and spent for the 
purpose of promotion of tourism and business travel in Arlington County.

County Manager may proceed to determine the amount due to the County and in connection therewith shall make
