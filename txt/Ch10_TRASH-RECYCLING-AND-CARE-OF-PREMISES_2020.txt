Any Collector desiring a permit to collect, transport, transfer, or store any Solid Waste shall make 
application  to  the  County.  Each  application  shall  be  in  the  form  specified  by  the  County  and  shall  include,  at  a 
minimum but not be limited to: the name of business, type of business, owner or authorized agent, business address, 
mailing address, email address, and telephone number of the applicant's place of business; the number and description 
of all vehicles and equipment to be used in the County; and/or a complete description of any proposed facility and 
operations at the facility. 
 
 

1. 

Before issuing any permit, the County may at its sole discretion cause an inspection to be made of 
the premises within the County and vehicles and equipment named and described in the application 
for a permit under this article for the purpose of determining whether the premises, vehicles, and/or 
equipment  comply  with  the  provisions  of  this  article, including,  but not  limited, to  the  standards 
established in § 10-42.C.7 of this article. If the County shall be satisfied from the inspection that the 
premises,  vehicles,  and/or  equipment  are  in  conformity  with  this  chapter,  then  the  County  shall 
issue, or cause to be issued, upon payment by the applicant to the County of the fee established in 
this article, a permit authorizing the applicant to collect, transport, transfer, or dispose of Solid Waste 
within the County, with such conditions as may be deemed necessary to comply with this article. 
The County shall assign a permit number to each approved Collection Vehicle and provide a visible 
permit (e.g., plate, sticker) that shall be permanently affixed by the applicant to both sides of the 
Collection Vehicle on the door of the cab or at the farthest point forward on the truck body. 
 
Every permit issued pursuant to this article shall be renewed annually. Permits shall expire according 
to a schedule specified by DES. Permits shall not be transferrable or prorated. In the event that any 
permitted  Collection  Vehicle  is removed  from  service  or  sold,  the  permit holder  shall notify  the 
County and the permit for that Collection Vehicle shall be removed and returned to the County no 
less than 10 business days following the vehicle's removal from service or sale. In the event that a 
permit is not recoverable, then the permit holder shall notify the County in writing of the permit 
number  of  said  Collection  Vehicle  and the  circumstances  of  loss  within  10 days,  which  shall  be 
done, as well as payment of a lost permit fee of fifty dollars ($50.00), before a replacement permit 
will be issued by the County. 

The  County  is  hereby  authorized  to  enter  and  inspect  any  premises,  except  the  interior  of  any 
residence, and vehicles in the County used by an applicant for a permit or a permittee in the business 
of collecting, transporting, transferring, storing, or disposing of Solid Waste. Any inspection shall 
be  made  during  business hours and  only  with  the  consent of  such  applicant  or  permittee  for  the 
purpose of enforcing the provisions of this article and for no other purpose. If the County shall not 
be so satisfied or if the applicant has refused the County the right to enter and inspect any premises, 
except  the  interior  of  any  residence,  and  vehicles  pursuant  to  §  10-42.C.3  for  the  purpose  of 
enforcing the provisions of this article, the County shall deny a permit application. 

If the County finds that the premises, vehicles, and/or equipment for which the permit was issued 
do not conform to the provisions of this article, that a permittee has refused the County the right to 
enter and inspect such premises, except the interior of any residence, or vehicles pursuant to § 10-
42.C.3 for the purposes of enforcing the provisions of this article, or that a permittee or an employee 
or agent of a permittee has  failed or neglected to comply with any of the minimum standards set 
forth in § 10-42.C.7, the County may enter an order for the suspension of the permit until such time 
as the County finds the reason for the suspension no longer exists. A copy of the order shall be sent 
to the permittee at his place of business by certified mail, which order shall set forth the reasons for 
the suspension. The suspension shall be effective ten (10) calendar days after the date it is executed 
by the County, and the order shall state this effective date; provided, however, that if the County

finds that an immediate suspension is necessary to protect the health or safety of County residents, 
the  suspension  shall  be  effective  immediately  and the  order  shall  so  state. Except in  cases  of  an 
immediate suspension, the order shall inform the permittee that he may dispute the suspension by 
written submission to the County, stating the reasons why the permit should not be suspended. The 
order shall also inform the permittee of the date and time by which such written submission must 
be  submitted.  If  the  permittee  does  not  make  a  timely  written  submission  to  the  County,  the 
suspension shall become effective and the order shall become final on the date set forth in the order. 
If  the  permittee  does  make  a  submission,  the  suspension  shall  be  stayed  pending  the  County’s 
consideration of the submission and the issuance of a final order affirming, amending, or rescinding 
the earlier order. This final order shall be effective on the date it is executed by the County and shall 
be sent to the permittee at his place of business by certified mail. The failure of a permittee to make 
a written or personal submission to the County shall not affect the County’s authority to reinstate a 
suspended  permit,  pursuant  to  §  10-42.C.5,  or  the  permittee's  right  to  appeal  a  final  order  of 
suspension,  pursuant  to  §  10-42.C.6.  It  shall  be  unlawful  for  any  Collector  to  collect,  transport, 
transfer, store, or dispose of any Solid Waste within the County  when subject to a  final order of 
suspension. 

The  County  may  reinstate  a  suspended  permit  when  no  fact  or  condition  exists  which  would 
otherwise warrant the County to refuse to grant a permit under the terms of this article. 

Any applicant aggrieved by the denial of an application for a Trash permit under § 10-42.C.1 and 
any permittee aggrieved by a final suspension order under § 10-42.C.4 shall have the right to appeal 
the denial or order to the County. The appeal shall be taken by filing with the County, within ten 
(10) calendar days of the date on which the notice of the denial has been mailed to such person's 
place of business or of the effective date of the final order, a written statement setting forth fully the 
grounds for appeal. The County shall schedule a hearing and shall give notice of the hearing to the 
appellant. The decision of the County on appeal shall be final, but shall not preclude the issuance of 
a permit or the reinstatement of a suspended permit by the County due to changed circumstances. 

Any Collector collecting, transporting, storing or disposing of Solid Waste in the County who does 
not  comply  with  the  following  minimum  standards  shall  be  subject  to  suspension  of  his  permit, 
pursuant to the provisions of § 10-42(c)(4) of this article.
