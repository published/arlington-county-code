WATER SUPPLY EMERGENCIES 

 
§ 38.1-8. Declaration of a Water Supply Emergency.  
 

Whenever the County Board finds that a water supply emergency exists, or is reasonably likely to occur if 
water conservation measures are not taken, the County Board may adopt an ordinance declaring an emergency and 
restricting or prohibiting the use of water by  County citizens for the duration of such emergency or for a period of 
time necessary to prevent the occurrence of a water supply emergency. Such a condition may be determined from 
information obtained by the County Board through the water supplier(s) of the County, information obtained from a 
recognized  authority,  recommendations  from  the  County  Manager  to  the  County  Board,  or  from  other  sources  as 
determined appropriate and prudent by the County Board.  
(Ord. No. 02-5, § 1, 4-20-02) 
 
§ 38.1-9. Application of Water Supply Emergency Restrictions.

§ 38.1-10. Exemption of Essential Uses for Public Health, Safety or Welfare.  
 

The provisions of any ordinance enacted by the County Board declaring a water supply emergency, and any 
restrictions or prohibitions implemented by the  County Manager, shall not apply to any governmental, business, or 
industrial use which is deemed by the County Manager to be essential to the preservation of the public health, safety, 
or welfare.  
(Ord. No. 02-5, § 1, 4-20-02) 
 
§ 38.1-11. Restrictions or Prohibitions to Address a Water Supply Emergency.  
 

Upon the adoption of an ordinance by the  County Board declaring a water supply emergency, the  County 
Manager  is  authorized  to  promulgate  and  implement,  in  writing,  voluntary  or  mandatory  water  consumption 
restrictions or prohibitions necessary to preserve the ability of the County to provide adequate and acceptable levels 
of potable water to preserve the public health, safety, and welfare. Water restrictions or prohibitions promulgated by 
the  County  Manager  may  include,  but  shall  not  be  limited  to,  restriction  or  prohibition  of  one  (1)  or  more  of  the

If,  at  any  time  after  the  County  Board  adopts  an  ordinance  declaring  a  water  supply  emergency  and  the 
County  Board  finds  that  a  water  supply  emergency  no  longer  exists,  then  the  County  Board  may,  by  ordinance, 
declare the water supply emergency ended. At any time during a water supply emergency, the County Manager may, 
by written declaration, declare the rescission, in whole or in part, of any restrictions or prohibitions promulgated and 
implemented under § 38.1-11. Such declarations by the County Board or the County Manager shall be based upon a 
factual finding that the ability of the County to deliver acceptable quantities of potable water is no longer limited, or 
that the extent of the declared emergency is reduced and that the existing restrictions or prohibitions, or some part 
thereof, are no longer required to protect the public health, safety, and welfare.  
(Ord. No. 02-5, § 1, 4-20-02) 
 
§ 38.1-13. Notification of Promulgation or Rescission of Mandatory Restrictions and Prohibitions.

promulgates,  or  rescinds,  mandatory  restrictions  or  prohibitions  authorized  by  this  chapter  or  by  any  ordinance 
adopted  hereunder.  Such  notification  shall  describe  the  mandatory  restrictions  and  prohibitions  promulgated  or 
rescinded  by  the  County  Manager,  the  effective  date  or  dates  thereof,  and  the  penalties  for  noncompliance.  Such 
notice to the general public shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation within the County and posted in 
a public place in the County Manager's office. Such notice shall be deemed due and proper notice to every customer 
supplied with water by the County.

§ 38.1-14. Waiver of Restrictions or Prohibitions.  
 

Upon receipt of a specific  written request by an individual customer of water supplied by the  County, the 
County  Manager,  for  good  cause  shown,  including  written  evidence  that  the  customer  is  adversely  affected  in  a 
significant  manner  not  common  to  other  businesses  or  persons  generally,  may  grant,  at  such  times  and  upon  such 
terms as the County Manager deems appropriate, a waiver to the customer, which waiver may permit less than full 
compliance with any of the restrictions or prohibitions promulgated hereunder. No waiver shall be granted unless the 
County Manager first determines that the public  health, safety, and  welfare  will not be adversely affected by such 
waiver.  All  waivers  granted by the  County Manager  shall  be reported to the  County Board prior to, or at, its next 
regularly scheduled meeting.  
(Ord. No. 02-5, § 1, 4-20-02) 
 
§ 38.1-15. Violations of this Chapter.  
 

A.  

After  adoption  by  the  County  Board  of  an  ordinance  declaring  a  water  supply  emergency,  and  after 
promulgation of any mandatory restrictions or prohibitions authorized by this chapter, or by such ordinance, it shall 
be unlawful for any person to violate any provision of such ordinance, restrictions or prohibitions.  
(Ord. No. 02-5, § 1, 4-20-02) 
 
§ 38.1-16. Penalties. 
 
Any  person  who  violates  or  fails  to  comply  with  any  of  the  provisions  of  this  chapter,  or  any 
 
ordinance enacted hereunder, or any mandatory restrictions or prohibitions promulgated pursuant to this  chapter, or 
pursuant  to  any  ordinance  enacted  hereunder,  may  be  charged  with  a  Class  3  misdemeanor  and,  upon  conviction, 
may be fined as provided in § 1-9 of this Code. 
 
 
A separate offense shall be deemed committed each day during which, or on which, a violation of, 
or  noncompliance  with,  this  chapter,  or  any  ordinance  enacted  hereunder,  or  any  such  mandatory  restrictions  or 
prohibitions promulgated hereunder, occurs or continues. The imposition of a fine or penalty for a violation of any 
provision  of  this  chapter,  or  any  ordinance  enacted  hereunder,  or  any  mandatory  restrictions  or  prohibitions 
promulgated hereunder shall not excuse the violation or permit it to continue. 
 
 
The County Manager may seek suspension of water service to any violator of this chapter, or any 
ordinance  enacted  hereunder,  or  any  mandatory  prohibitions  or  restrictions  promulgated  hereunder,  by  injunction, 
abatement,  or  other  appropriate  legal  remedy,  if  the  County  Manager  determines  that  such  action  is  necessary  to 
prevent any continued or future violation.
