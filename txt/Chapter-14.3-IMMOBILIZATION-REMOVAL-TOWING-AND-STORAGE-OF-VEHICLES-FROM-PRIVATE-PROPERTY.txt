in circumstances where their vehicles have been towed from private property without their consent and placed in 
storage because of a variety of factors.  Those factors include, but are not limited to, unfair and predatory towing and 
pricing practices, inadequate notice of when vehicles are subject to towing, unreasonable prices for towing and 
storage, and lack of adequate recourse in the event of improper towing or storage. Based upon the foregoing, the 
County Board has concluded that the regulations provided for by this chapter are required to protect the public 
health, safety and welfare generally, and particularly the safety of those members of the public whose vehicles have 
been towed from private property without their consent and stored, as well as the public interest in ensuring that the 
prices charged for such non-consensual tows from private property are fair and reasonable.

Upon request by an Arlington County law enforcement officer, all towing and recovery operators 
conducting trespass tows from private property in Arlington County shall provide the information 
in subsection 2 as well as any other requested information. 

The tow truck driver and/or towing and recovery operator performing the tow shall obtain 
authorization of the owner, operator, or lessee of the property from which the vehicle is towed, or

offices, and at the property, respectively, copies of all contracts or other documents that appoint 
the operator as the authorized agent for the owner, operator or lessee of the property for purposes

All tow truck drivers shall have their Driver Authorization Document in their possession at all 
times while performing towing operations. 

All tow trucks shall meet all applicable federal, state and local regulations and safety standards.  
Operators shall only use vehicles and equipment designed and rated for the type of vehicle being

corners of the vehicle so that for each photograph, the viewer can see two sides of the car at once).

or video, failure to do so shall not constitute a violation of this provision.

The tow truck used to perform the tow shall include the name, street address, and current, local 
telephone number of the towing and recovery operator permanently affixed in a conspicuous 
location on the exterior of the truck.
