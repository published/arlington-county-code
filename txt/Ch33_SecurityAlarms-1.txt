IN GENERAL 

 
§ 33-1. Declaration of Findings and Policy.  
 

It is hereby  declared  that  false  alarm  calls  within  Arlington  County  results in  an  inefficient  use  of  police 
resources,  reduces  faith  in  security  alarm  signals,  and  promotes  complacency  in  police  investigation  of  alarm 
signals.  This  creates  a  general  safety  hazard  detrimental  to  protection  of  property  and  to  the  health,  safety  and 
welfare of citizens, and to the police personnel responsible for the investigation of alarm signals.

(60) days from the date of receipt may result in the suspension of the alarm user registration and a discontinuance of 
police  response  to  alarms  that  may  occur  at the  protected  premises  described  in the  alarm  user's registration  until 
such time that payment is received. 
 
 
To  ensure  that  the  assessed  amounts  are  representative  of  the  costs  incurred  by  the  County  to 
provide  alarm  responses  and  to  administer  this  chapter,  the  amounts  contained  in  the  false  alarm  response  fee 
schedule shall be evaluated and amended, as necessary, on an annual basis.

(12) month calculation period, the Chief of Police or his designee may require that the alarm user, at the alarm user's 
expense, cause their alarm system to be inspected by an alarm company licensed to conduct business in Arlington 
County.  The  inspection  shall  entail  a  complete  examination  of  the  alarm  system  including,  but  not  limited  to, 
satisfactory design and installation of the equipment, proper functioning of the equipment, and user education in the 
operation of the equipment. The alarm company shall record the details of the inspection and certify that the alarm 
system is operating properly and that the appropriate persons have been re-educated in the proper operations of the 
system  on  a  form  provided  by  the  Police  Department  for  this  purpose.  The  completed  inspection  report  shall  be 
returned to the Police Department within thirty (30) days of the initial notification to the alarm user. 
 
 
In the event that eight (8) or more false alarms occur at a protected premise within any twelve (12) 
month  calculation  period,  the  Chief  of  Police  or  his  designee  may  require  that  the  alarm  user  cause  their  alarm

§ 33-16. Administrative Appeal Hearing. 
 
 
In the event an inspection order is issued to an alarm user, administrative fees are assessed, or the 
registration of an alarm user is suspended, the alarm user may request an appeal hearing to determine whether there 
is just cause for such action. 
 
 
The hearing shall be held before a hearing officer who shall have been appointed by the  County 
Manager.  The  hearing  shall  be  held  within  seventy-two  (72)  hours  after  the  request  is  filed  with  the  Police 
Department unless an extension has been agreed upon by both the alarm user and the Police Department. 
 
 
The alarm user shall have the right to appear and present witnesses and other  evidence, but there 
shall be no formal rules of procedure required for the conduct of the hearing and the hearing officer shall not have 
the power to compel the attendance of witnesses or the production of other evidence. 
 
 
The hearing officer shall proceed forthwith to hear the matter and to determine by a preponderance 
of the evidence whether there is probable cause to believe that the provision of this chapter have been applied, fairly 
and impartially. The hearing officer shall have authority, if he determines that there is insufficient evidence to fully 
support imposition of an inspection requirement, registration suspension, or administrative service fees, to order that 
any inspection requirements, registration suspension, or fees imposed under this chapter be waived or rescinded in 
whole or in part.
